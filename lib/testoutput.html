<div class="paper_content"><p>In today's competitive and highly dynamic environment, analyzing data to understand how the business is performing and to predict outcomes and trends has become critical. The traditional approach to reporting is no longer adequate. Instead users now demand easy-to-use intelligent platforms and applications capable of analyzing real-time data to provide insight and actionable information at the right time. The end goal is to support better and timelier decision making, enabled by the availability of up-to-date, high quality information. Although there has been progress in this direction and many companies are introducing products towards meeting this goal, there is still a long way to go. In particular, the whole lifecycle of business intelligence requires innovative techniques and methodologies capable of dealing with the requirements imposed by these new generation of BI applications. From the capture of real-time business data to the transformation and delivery of actionable information, all the stages of the Business Intelligence (BI) cycle call for new algorithms and paradigms to support value-added functionalities. These functionalities include dynamic integration of real-time data feeds from operational sources, optimization and evolution of ETL transformations and analytical models, and dynamic generation of adaptive real-time dashboards, just to name a few. The series of BIRTE workshops, starting in 2006, have always been held in conjunction with VLDB. The series aims to provide a forum to discuss topics related to this emerging field and set research directions towards making business intelligence more real-time. Following the success of previous BIRTE editions (2006, 2008-2012) submissions for research, industrial and position papers on relevant topics are encouraged.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>The TPC has played, and continues to play, a crucial role in providing the computer industry with relevant industry-standard benchmarks. Vendors and endusers rely on TPC benchmarks to provide real-world data that is backed by a stringent and independent review process. Vendors also use TPC benchmarks to demonstrate performance competitiveness for their existing products, and to improve/monitor the performance of products-under-development. Many buyers often use TPC benchmark results as points of comparison when purchasing new computing systems. The technology landscape is continually evolving and challenging industry experts and researchers to develop innovative techniques to evaluate and benchmark computing systems. The TPC remains committed to developing highly relevant benchmark standards and will continue to develop new benchmarks to keep pace. With this conference, the TPC encourages researchers and industry experts to submit novel ideas and methodologies in performance evaluation, measurement, and characterization. Selected papers may be considered for future TPC benchmark developments. Proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag as Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>The problem of poor data quality in databases, data warehousing and information systems largely and indistinctly affects every application domain. Many data processing tasks (such as information integration, data sharing, information retrieval, and knowledge discovery from databases) require various forms of data preparation and consolidation with complex data processing techniques, because the data input to the algorithms is assumed to conform to nice data distributions, containing no missing, inconsistent or incorrect values. This leaves a large gap between the available "dirty" data and the available machinery to process the data for application purposes. Building on the established tradition of nine previous international workshops on the topic of Data and Information Quality, namely IQIS 2004-2006, CleanDB 2006 and QDB 2007-2012, the 2013 Quality in Databases (QDB) workshop, co-located with VLDB2013, is a qualified forum for presenting and discussing novel ideas and solutions related to the problems of assessing, monitoring, improving, and maintaining the quality of data.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Crowdsourcing systems, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower, utilize human power to perform difficult tasks, such as entity resolution, search, filtering, image matching, or clustering. The important issues of collecting and managing the large volume of data in these applications have attracted plenty of attention from the database community. The goal of DBCrowd 2013, the First VLDB Workshop on Databases and Crowdsourcing, is to provide an avenue for database researchers and practitioners to disseminate and explore new research directions and promising results at the confluence of crowdsourcing and database areas.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>The increasing functionality and capacity of mobile devices have enabled new mobile applications which require new approaches for data management. Information management in mobile applications is a complex problem space which requires the consideration of constraints on energy, CPU power, storage, etc. In addition, mobile data can have various forms, such as sensor data, user profiles &amp; user context, spatial data, and multimedia data. The International Workshop on Information Management for Mobile Applications aims at a broad range of mobile application fields and wants to provide a forum for the discussion about technologies and mechanisms, which support the management of mobile, complex, integrated, distributed, and heterogeneous data-focused applications.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>With the increasing success of cloud computing, cloud business intelligence "as a service" offerings have sparkled widely, both from cloud start-ups and major BI industry vendors. Beyond porting BI features into the cloud, which already implies numerous issues (e.g., BigData/NoSQL database modeling and storage, data localization, security and privacy, performance, cost and usage models...), this trend also poses new, broader challenges for making data analytics available to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), non-governmental organizations, web communities (e.g., supported by social networks), and even the average citizen; this vision presumably requiring a mixture of both private and open data. The aim of the Cloud-I workshop is to become an interdisciplinary, regular exchange forum for researchers, industry and practitioners, as well as all potential users of Cloud Intelligence. The submission of research, industrial, position, visionary, survey and student papers are encouraged to fuel up the discussion.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Over the last 30 years, memory prices have been dropping by a factor of 10 every 5 years. Main memory is the “new disk” for data storage. The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) in DRAM is far greater than other storage media such as hard disks and SSDs. DRAM is readily available in the market at better price point in comparison to DRAM-alternatives. These trends make DRAM a better storage media for latency-sensitive data management applications, large-scale web applications, and future applications such as wearable devices. The first international workshop on In-memory Memory Data Management and Analytics (IMDM 2013) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the proliferation of in-memory data management and analytics infrastructures. The workshop is a forum to present research challenges, novel ideas and methodologies that can improve in-memory (main memory) data management and analytics. The proceedings of IMDM 2013 are planned to be published by Springer-Verlag as Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in developing effective techniques for ad-hoc search and ranked retrieval in relational databases, XML, RDF and graph databases, text and multimedia databases, scientific information systems, social networks, and many more. In particular, a large number of emerging applications require an explorative form of querying on such general-purpose or domain-specific databases; examples include users wishing to search bibliographic databases or catalogues of products, such as homes, cars, cameras, restaurants, photographs, etc. Current database query languages, such as SQL, XQuery or SPARQL, are designed for expert users and follow a Boolean retrieval model, which is inadequate for exploratory users who cannot articulate their perfect query needs. Top-k queries and ranking query results are gaining increasing importance to address the needs of exploratory users. In fact, in many of these applications, ranking is an integral part of the semantics, e.g., for keyword search, similarity search in multimedia as well as document collections. The increasing importance of ranking is directly derived from the explosion in the volume of data that is handled by current applications. Without ranking, users would frequently be overwhelmed by too many results. Furthermore, the sheer amount of data makes it almost impossible to process queries in a traditional compute-then-sort approach. Hence, ranking comes as a great tool for soliciting user preferences and data exploration. Ranking imposes several challenges for almost all data-centric systems. DBRank 2013 serves as a platform for the discussion of challenges, research, and applications in the context of ranking for relational, XML, RDF, text, multimedia, multidimensional, and social data.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>The VLDB PhD workshop is a forum for PhD students working in the broad areas addressed by the VLDB conference itself. This forum aims to facilitate interactions among PhD students and to stimulate feedback from more experienced researchers. We welcome submissions from PhD students at any stage of their PhD work. PhD workshop papers are meant to present on-going thesis work in 6 pages. Those starting their PhDs should describe the problem they focus on, explain why it is important, detail why the existing solutions are not sufficient, and give an outline of the new solutions that are pursued. Those in the middle or close to completion should be more concrete in describing their contribution, still in the context of their doctoral work. Note that specific portions of the thesis work might have been published or submitted to publication. Again this year, the accepted papers will be published in the VLDB proceedings. This workshop should be an opportunity for the upcoming generation of database researchers to share their work and get to know each other, and an opportunity for the rest of the database community to meet future colleagues and find out about the new ideas emerging in a variety of universities.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>As the amount of streaming data produced by large-scale systems such as environmental monitoring, scientific experiments and communication networks grows rapidly, new approaches are needed to effectively process and analyze such data. There are several promising directions in the area of large-scale distributed computation, that is, where multiple computing entities work together over partitions of the massive, streaming data to perform complex computations. Two important paradigms in this realm are continuous distributed monitoring (i.e., continually maintaining an accurate estimate of a complex query), and distributed and cluster-based systems that allow the processing of big, streaming data (e.g., IBM System S, Amazon S4, and Twitter Storm). The aim of the BD3 workshop is to bring together computer scientists with interests in this field to present recent innovations, find topics of common interest and to stimulate further development of new approaches to deal with massive dynamic and distributed data.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>For over 25 years, DBPL has established itself as the principal venue for publishing and discussing new ideas at the intersection of databases and programming languages. Many key contributions in query languages for object-oriented data, persistent databases, nested relational data, and semistructured data, as well as fundamental ideas in types for query languages, were first announced at DBPL. Today, the emergence of new data management applications such as cloud computing and “big data,” social network analysis, bidirectional programming, and data privacy has lead to a new flurry of creative research in this area, as well as a tremendous amount of activity in industry. DBPL is an established destination for such new ideas.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>The past decade produced a rich ecosystem of web sites that provide personalized access to (semi-)structured data: financial asset tracking and management sites, personalized news delivery services, and even customized web search engines are all but a few examples. A second wave of innovation has been fueled by the explosive growth of web platforms that enable rich online social interactions, such as online social networks, web communities, wikis, and mashups. These new applications go beyond personalized information access and dissemination. Users can now transcend their role of passive content consumers and engage in content creation, sharing, and various forms of online collaboration as well. This online collaboration has recently moved to the next level through crowdsourcing: applications that enable users to help other users in completing their tasks. All aforementioned applications rely critically on user-centric data — such as profile data, preferences, activity logs, location, group memberships, and social connections — to provide a personalized experience, including personalized search results, personalized ads, product recommendations, coupons and so forth. Additionally, online social applications provide an unprecedented amount of user-contributed social and context data. The interconnected nature of personalized, social, and contextual data management problems as well as the fertile research ground these represent motivate a discussion on these problems within the database community. We need to obtain a common understanding of new challenges and to collaborate on the design of new models, algorithms, and systems for emerging applications. The PersDB 2013 workshop aims at providing the appropriate venue for discussion and debate of the relevant issues and at nurturing related future research and applications.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>We are witnessing a smooth evolution of the Web from a worldwide information space of linked documents to a global knowledge base, composed of semantically interconnected resources. The continuous publishing and the integration of the plethora of semantic datasets from companies, government and public sector projects is leading to the creation of the so-called Web of Knowledge. As a matter of facts, researchers are now looking with growing interest to semantic issues in this huge amount of correlated data available on the Web. Many progresses have been made in the field of semantic technologies, from formal models to repositories and reasoning engines. The third edition of the International Workshop on Semantic Search over the Web (SSW) will discuss about data management issues related to the search over the web and the relationships with semantic web technologies, proposing new models, languages and applications. The SSW Workshop invites researchers, engineers, service developers to present their research and works in the field of data management for semantic search. Papers may deal with methods, models, case studies, practical experiences and technologies.</p></div>

<p>Milind Bhandarkar (Machine Learning Platforms, Pivotal Inc.)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Apache Hadoop has rapidly become the de facto data
 processing platform, and is often mentioned synonymously with "Big
 Data". Hadoop started as a project within Apache Lucene and Nutch 
        to scale the content backend for web search engine.
 However, it is currently being used in majority of Fortune 500
 companies, in many other application domains, such as fraud detection
 at credit card companies, healthcare analytics, churn detection and
 prevention at Telecom companies etc. In this talk, we will reminisce
 about the early days of Hadoop at Yahoo, and lessons learned in
 scaling this platform from a 20-node prototype to a datacenter-wide
 production deployment. We will give an overview of the current state
 of Hadoop ecosystem, and present some prominent patterns and use cases
 of this platform. We will also discuss how Hadoop is evolving, and its
 future as a platform for "Big Data" processing.</p></div>

<p>Tova Milo (Tel Aviv University)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Harnessing a crowd of Web users for data collection has recently become a widespread phenomenon. A key challenge is that the human knowledge forms an open world and it is thus difficult to know what kind of information we should be looking for. Classic databases have addressed this problem by data mining techniques that identify interesting data patterns. These techniques, however, are not suitable for the crowd. This is mainly due to properties of the human memory, such as the tendency to remember simple trends and summaries rather than exact details. Following these observations, we develop here a novel model for crowd mining. We will consider in the talk the logical, algorithmic, and methodological foundations needed for such a mining process, as well as the applications that can benefit from the knowledge mined from crowd.</p></div>

<p>Maria Luisa Damiani (University of Milan, Italy)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Semantic trajectory is a relatively recent concept developed to flexibly represent the history of locations of an entity moving continuously or nearly continuously in a reference space (i.e.trajectory). The key idea is to supplement the geometric representation of a trajectory – usually called raw trajectory - with thematic information describing application-dependent, time-varying features of the entity‘s movement. For example semantic trajectories can be used to describe the sequence of points of interest visited by tourists in a city, or the sequence of transportation means used by inviduals traveling in an urban setting for work or leisure. In semantic trajectories, single positions or sequences of positions inside a trajectory can be semantically annotated. This makes possible a fine-grained description of the behaviour of the moving object. The notion of semantic trajectory, however, opens up a number of issues. For example semantic trajectories magnify the risk to privacy because behavior information on individuals is explicitly extracted and represented in a machine-readable form, and therefore can be used within information processing applications and easily revealed to third parties. For this reason, semantic trajectories and privacy may clash. Moreover, the notion of semantic trajectory, while extensively investigated at conceptual level, still lacks an operational and rigorous definition. In particular it is still open to the problem of specifying how to handle and query large amounts of semantic trajectories so as to make this concept usable in real, data intensive mobile applications. In this presentation, I will discuss on-going research on these issues and emphasize the evolution of the notion of moving object.</p></div>

 by extending the Blue Gene/Q architecture with Integrated Non-volatile
 Memory</strong></h4>
<p>Blake Fitch  (IBM T. J. Watson Research Center)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Emerging storage class memories offer a set of challenges
 and opportunities in system architecture, programming models, and
 application design. We are exploring the close integration of emerging
 solid-state storage technologies in conjunction with high performance
 networks and integrated processing capability. Specifically, we
 consider the extension of the Blue Gene/Q architecture by integrating
 Flash into the node to enable a scalable, data-centric computing
 platform. We are using BG/Q as a rapid prototyping platform allowing
 us to build a research system based on an infrastructure with proven
 scalability to thousands of nodes. Our work also involves enabling a
 Linux environment with standard network interfaces on the BG/Q
 hardware. We plan to explore applications of this system architecture
 including existing file systems and middleware as well as more
 aggressive compute-in-storage approaches. Compute-in-storage is
 intended to enable the use of high performance (HPC) programming
 techniques (MPI) to implement data-centric algorithms (e.g. sort,
 join, graph) that execute on processing elements embedded within a
 storage system. This presentation will review the architectural
 extension to BG/Q, present a progress report on the project, and
 describe some early results.</p></div>

<p>Jiong HE (Nanyang Technological University), Mian Lu (A*STAR Institute of High Performance Computing), Bingsheng He (NTU Singapore)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Query co-processing on graphics processors (GPUs) has become an
effective means to improve the performance of main memory databases.
However, the relatively low bandwidth and high latency of the PCI-e
bus is usually a bottleneck issue for such co-processing. Recently,
coupled CPU-GPU architectures have received a lot of
attentions, e.g., AMD APUs with the CPU and the GPU integrated into
a single chip. That opens up new opportunities for optimizing query
co-processing. In this paper, we experimentally revisit hash joins,
one of the most important join algorithms for main memory databases,
on such coupled CPU-GPU architectures. Particularly, we study the
fine-grained co-processing mechanisms on hash joins with and
without partitioning. The co-processing outlines an interesting
design space. We extend existing cost models to automatically guide
decisions on the design space. Our experimental results on a recent
AMD APU show that (1) the coupled architecture enables fine-grained
co-processing and cache reuses, which are inefficient on
discrete CPU-GPU architectures; (2) carefully designs and
tuning are important for the performance of co-processing on the
coupled architecture, and the cost model can automatically guide the
tuning knobs in the design space; (3) fine-grained co-processing
achieves up to 53.35%, 35.82%, 28.74% performance improvement
compared
with CPU-only, GPU-only and conventional CPU-GPU co-processing.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>The multi-core architectures of today's computer systems make parallelism a necessity for performance critical applications. Writing such applications in a generic, hardware-oblivious manner is a challenging problem: Current database systems thus rely on labor-intensive and error-prone manual tuning to exploit the full potential of modern parallel hardware architectures like multi-core CPUs and GPUs. We propose an alternative design for a parallel database engine, based around a single set of hardware-oblivious operators, which are compiled down to the actual hardware at runtime. This approach reduces the development overhead for parallel database systems, while achieving competitive performance to  hand-tuned systems.
We provide a proof-of-concept for this design by integrating operators written using the parallel programming framework OpenCL into the open-source database MonetDB. Thereby, we achieve efficient, yet highly portable parallel code without the need for optimization by hand. We evaluate our implementation against MonetDB using TPC-H derived queries and observed a performance that rivals that of the parallelized MonetDB query execution on the CPU, and surpassed it on the GPU. In addition, we show that the same set of operators runs nearly unchanged on a GPU, demonstrating the feasability of our approach.</p></div>

<p>Radu Stoica (EPFL), Anastasia Ailamaki (EPFL)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Solid-state drives (SSDs) are quickly becoming the default storage medium for database systems as the cost of NAND flash memory continues to drop. However, flash memory introduces new challenges due to its asymmetry between reading and writing. A software Flash Translation Layer (FTL) is used to overcome the technology's limitations and to give applications the illusion of a traditional block device by storing data in a log-structured fashion.
Despite a large number of existing FTL algorithms, performance, predictability, and device lifetime remain an issue, especially for write-intensive workloads specific to database applications.

In this paper, we show that more efficient FTLs and improved SSD endurance are both possible by using the I/O write skew to guide data placement on flash memory. We model the relationship between data placement and write performance for basic I/O write patterns and detail the most important concepts of writing to flash memory: i) the trade-off between the extra capacity available and write overhead, ii) the benefit of adapting data placement to write skew, iii) the impact of the space reclamation policy, and iv) how to estimate the best achievable write performance for a given I/O workload. Based on the findings of the theoretical model, we propose a new principled data placement algorithm that can be incorporated into any existing FTL proposal. We show the benefits of our data placement algorithm when running micro-benchmarks and real database I/O traces: our data placement algorithm reduces write overhead by 20% - 75% when compared to state-of-art techniques.</p></div>

<p>Xin Liu (University of Waterloo), Kenneth Salem (University of Waterloo)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Flash-based solid state drives (SSD) are becoming a part of the storage system. Adding SSD to a storage system not only raises the question of how to manage the SSD, but also raises the question of whether current buffer pool algorithms will still work effectively. We are interested in the use of hybrid storage systems, consisting of SSDs and hard disk drives (HDD), for database management. We present cost-aware replacement algorithms for both the DBMS buffer pool and the SSD. These algorithms are aware of the different I/O performance of HDD and SDD. In such a hybrid storage system, the physical access pattern to the SSD depends on the management of the DBMS buffer pool. We studied the impact of the buffer pool caching policies on the access patterns of the SSD. Based on these studies, we designed a cost-adjusted caching policy to effectively manage the SSD. We implemented these algorithms in MySQL's InnoDB storage engine and used the TPC-C workload to demonstrate that these cost-aware algorithms outperform previous algorithms.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>The Big Data era is upon us: data is being generated, collected and analyzed at an unprecedented scale, and data-driven decision making is sweeping through all aspects of society. Since the value of data explodes when it can be linked and fused with other data, addressing the big data integration (BDI) challenge is critical to realizing the promise of Big Data. DI differs from traditional data integration in many dimensions: (i) the number of data sources, even for a single domain, has grown to be in the tens of thousands, (ii) many of the data sources are very dynamic, as a huge amount of newly collected data are continuously made available, (iii) the data sources are extremely heterogeneous in their structure, with considerable variety even for substantially similar entities, and (iv) the data sources are of widely differing qualities, with significant differences in the coverage, accuracy and timeliness of data provided. This tutorial explores the progress that has been made by the data integration community on the topics of schema mapping, record linkage and data fusion in addressing these novel challenges faced by big data integration, and identifies a range of open problems for the community.</p></div>

<p>Guimei Liu (National University of Singapore), Andre Suchitra (National University of Singapore), Limsoon Wong (National University of Singapore)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Frequent itemset mining is an important problem in the data mining area. Extensive efforts have been devoted to developing efficient algorithms for mining frequent itemsets. However, not much attention is paid on managing the large collection of frequent itemsets produced by these algorithms for subsequent analysis and for user exploration. In this paper, we study three structures for indexing and querying frequent itemsets: inverted files, signature files and CFP-tree. The first two structures have been widely used for indexing general set-valued data. We make some modifications to make them more suitable for indexing frequent itemsets. The CFP-tree structure is specially designed for storing frequent itemsets. We add a pruning technique based on length-2 frequent itemsets to make it more efficient for processing superset queries. 
We study the performance of the three structures in supporting five types of containment queries: exact match, subset/superset search and immediate subset/superset search. Our results show that no structure can outperform other structures for all the five types of queries on all the datasets. CFP-tree shows better overall performance than the other two structures. </p></div>

<p>Kyriakos Mouratidis (Singapore Management University), HweeHwa Pang (Singapore Management University)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Given a high-dimensional dataset, a top-k query can be used to shortlist the k tuples that best match the user's preferences. Typically, these preferences regard a subset of the available dimensions (i.e., attributes) whose relative significance is expressed by user-specified weights. Along with the query result, we propose to compute for each involved dimension the maximal deviation to the corresponding weight for which the query result remains valid. The derived weight ranges, called immutable regions, are useful for performing sensitivity analysis, for finetuning the query weights, etc.

In this paper, we focus on top-k queries with linear preference functions over the queried dimensions. We codify the conditions under which changes in a dimension's weight invalidate the query result, and develop algorithms to compute the immutable regions. In general, this entails the examination of numerous non-result tuples. To reduce processing time, we introduce a pruning technique and a thresholding mechanism that allow the immutable regions to be determined correctly after examining only a small number of non-result tuples. We demonstrate empirically that the two techniques combine well to form a robust and highly resource-efficient algorithm. We verify the generality of our findings using real high-dimensional data from different domains (documents, images, etc) and with different characteristics.

<p>Yang Wang (Fudan University), Peng Wang (Fudan University), Jian Pei (Simon Fraser University), Wei Wang (Fudan University),Sheng Huang (IBM Research China)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Similarity search on time series is an essential operation in many applications. In the state-of-the-art methods, such as the R-tree based methods, SAX and iSAX, time series are by default divided into equi-length segments globally, that is, all time series are segmented in the same way. Those methods then focus on how to approximate or symbolize the segments and construct indexes. In this paper, we make an important observation: global segmentation of all time series may incur unnecessary cost in space and time for indexing time series. We develop DSTree, a data adaptive and dynamic segmentation index on time series. In addition to savings in space and time, our new index can provide tight upper and lower bounds on distances between time series. An extensive empirical study shows that our new index DSTree supports time series similarity search effectively and efficiently.</p></div>

<p>Justin Levandoski (Microsoft Research), David Lomet (Microsoft Research), Sudipta Sengupta (Microsoft Research)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>LLAMA (Latch-free, Log-structured Access Method Aware) is a caching and storage subsystem for new hardware environments (e.g., flash, multi-core). LLAMA supports an API for page-oriented access methods that provides both cache and storage management, optimizing processor caches and secondary storage. Caching (CL) and storage (SL) layers use a common mapping table that separates a page’s logical and physical location. CL supports data updates and management updates (e.g., for index re-organization) via latch-free compare-and-swap atomic state changes on its mapping table. SL uses the same mapping table to cope with the page location changes produced by log structuring on every page flush. To demonstrate LLAMA’s suitability, we tailored our latch-free Bw-tree implementation to use LLAMA. The Bw-tree, is an ordered B-tree style index. Executing on LLAMA, it exhibits much higher performance and multi-core scalability using real workloads compared with BerkeleyDB’s B-tree, which is known for good performance.</p></div>

Users specify a directed computation graph and application code for individual nodes, and the system manages persistent state and the continuous flow of records, all within the envelope of the framework's fault-tolerance guarantees.     This paper describes MillWheel's programming model as well as its implementation. The case study of a continuous anomaly detector in use at Google serves to motivate how many of MillWheel's features are used.  MillWheel's programming model provides a notion of logical time, making it simple to write time-based aggregations.  MillWheel was designed from the outset with fault tolerance and scalability in mind.   In practice, we find that MillWheel's unique combination of scalability, fault tolerance, and a versatile programming model lends itself to a wide variety of problems at Google.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>DB2 BLU deeply integrates within IBM's DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows new techniques for defining and processing column-organized tables that speed read-mostly Business Intelligence queries by 10 to 50 times and improve compression by  3 to 10 times, compared to traditional row-organized tables, without the complexity of defining indexes or materialized views on those tables. But DB2 BLU is much more than just a column store. Exploiting frequency-based dictionary compression and main-memory query processing technology from the Blink project at IBM Research - Almaden, DB2 BLU performs most SQL operations -- predicate application (even range predicates and IN-lists), joins, and grouping -- on the compressed values, which can be packed bit-aligned so densely that multiple values fit in a register and can be processed simultaneously via SIMD (single-instruction, multiple-data) instructions. Designed and built from the ground up to exploit modern multi-core processors, DB2 BLU's hardware-conscious algorithms are carefully engineered to maximize parallelism by using novel data structures that need little latching, and to minimize data-cache and instruction-cache misses. Though DB2 BLU is optimized for in-memory processing, table size is not limited by the size of main memory. Fine-grained synopses, late materialization, and aggressive prefetching minimize disk I/Os. Full integration with DB2 ensures that DB2 BLU benefits from the full functionality and robust utilities of a mature product, while still enjoying order-of-magnitude performance gains without even having to change the SQL, and can mix column-organized and row-organized tables in the same tablespace and even within the same query.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>The Quantcast File System (QFS) is an efficient alternative  to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). QFS is  written in C++, is plugin-compatible with Hadoop MapReduce  and offers several efficiency improvements relative to  HDFS: 50% disk space savings through erasure coding instead  of replication, corresponding 2x higher write throughput,  faster namenode, support for faster sorting and logging  through a concurrent append feature, a native command  line client much faster than hadoop fs, and global feedback-directed I/O device management. As QFS works out of the  box with Hadoop, migrating data from HDFS to QFS involves  simply executing hadoop distcp. QFS is being developed  fully open-source and is available under an Apache  license from https://github.com/quantcast/qfs. Multi-petabyte QFS instances have been in heavy production use  since 2011.</p></div>

<p>Rui Liu (University of Waterloo), Ashraf Aboulnaga (University of Waterloo), Kenneth Salem (University of Waterloo)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Many applications hosted on the cloud have sophisticated data management needs that are best served by a SQL-based relational DBMS.  It is not difficult to run a DBMS in the cloud, and in many cases one DBMS instance is enough to support an application's workload. However, a DBMS running in the cloud (or even on a local server) still needs a way to persistently store its data and protect it against failures. One way to achieve this is to provide a scalable and reliable storage service that the DBMS can access over a network. This paper describes such a service, which we call DAX.  DAX relies on multi-master replication and Dynamo-style flexible consistency, which enables it to run in multiple data centers and hence be disaster tolerant.  Flexible consistency allows DAX to control the consistency level of each read or write operation, choosing between strong consistency at the cost of high latency or weak consistency with low latency, by applying protocols that we designed based on the characteristics of how a DBMS uses its storage tier.  With these protocols, DAX provides a storage service that can host multiple DBMS tenants, scaling in the number of tenants and the required storage capacity and bandwidth. DAX also provides high availability and disaster tolerance for the DBMS storage tier.  Experiments using the TPC-C benchmark show that DAX provides up to a factor of 4 performance improvement over baseline solutions that do not exploit flexible consistency.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Web service providers have been using NoSQL datastores to provide scalability and availability for globally distributed data at the cost of sacrificing transactional guarantees.  Recently, major web service providers like Google have moved towards building storage systems that provide ACID transactional guarantees for globally distributed data.  For example, the newly published system, Spanner, uses Two-Phase Commit and Two-Phase Locking to provide atomicity and isolation for globally distributed data, running on top of Paxos to provide fault-tolerant log replication.  We show in this paper that it is possible to provide the same ACID transactional guarantees for multi-datacenter databases with fewer cross-datacenter communication trips, compared to replicated logging, by using a more efficient architecture.  Instead of replicating the transactional log, we replicate the commit operation itself, by running Two-Phase Commit multiple times in different datacenters, and we use Paxos to reach consensus among datacenters as to whether the transaction should commit. Doing so not only replaces several inter-datacenter communication trips with intra-datacenter communication trips, but also allows us to integrate atomic commitment and isolation protocols with consistent replication protocols so as to further reduce the number of cross-datacenter communication trips needed for consistent replication; for example, by eliminating the need for an election phase in Paxos.  We analyze our approach in terms of communication trips to compare it against the replication log approach, then we conduct an extensive experimental study to compare the performance and scalability of both approaches under various multi-datacenter setups.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>A wide range of applications including bioinformatics, time series, and log analysis, depend on the identification of repetitions in very long sequences. Maximal pairs represent a superset of the most important types of repetitions. Existing maximal pair computation methods require both the input sequence and its index structure (which is at least an order of magnitude larger than the input) to fit in memory. Moreover, they are serial algorithms with prohibitively long execution time. Therefore, they are limited to small datasets, despite the fact that modern applications demand orders of magnitude longer sequences.

In this paper we present RACE, a parallel system for finding maximal repeats in very long sequences. RACE supports parallel execution on stand-alone multi-core systems, but can scale to thousands of nodes on clusters or supercomputers. RACE does not require the input or the index to fit in memory; therefore, it supports very long sequences with limited memory. Moreover, it uses a novel array representation that traverses the tree in a cache-efficient manner. RACE is particularly suitable for the cloud (e.g., Amazon EC2) since, based on availability, it can scale elastically to more or fewer machines during its execution. Since scaling out introduces overheads, mainly due to load imbalance, we propose a cost model to estimate the expected speedup for a specific problem size and computing infrastructure, based on statistics gathered through sampling. The model allows the user to select the appropriate combination of cloud resources based on the provider's prices and the required deadline. We contacted extensive experimental evaluation with large real datasets and large computing infrastructures. In contrast to existing methods, RACE can handle the entire human genome on a single machine with 16GB RAM. Moreover, for a problem that takes 10 hours of serial execution, RACE finishes in 28 seconds using 2,048 nodes on an IBM BlueGene/P supercomputer.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Distributed storage systems for large clusters typically use replication to provide reliability. Recently, erasure codes have been used to reduce the large storage overhead of three-replicated systems. Reed-Solomon codes are the standard design choice and their high repair cost is often considered an unavoidable price to pay for high storage efficiency and high reliability.

This paper shows how to overcome this limitation. We present a novel family of erasure codes that are efficiently repairable and offer higher reliability compared to Reed-Solomon codes. We show analytically that our codes are optimal on a recently identified tradeoff between locality and minimum distance.

We implement our new codes in Hadoop HDFS and compare to a currently deployed HDFS module that uses Reed-Solomon codes. Our modified HDFS implementation shows a reduction of approximately 2x on the repair disk I/O and repair network traffic. The disadvantage of the new coding scheme is that it requires 14% more storage compared to Reed-Solomon codes, an overhead shown to be information theoretically optimal to obtain locality. Because the new codes repair failures faster, this provides higher reliability, which is orders of magnitude higher compared to replication.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Query scheduling, a fundamental problem in database management systems, has recently received renewed attention, perhaps in part due to the rise of the “database as a service” (DaaS) model for database deployment. While there has been a great deal of work investigating different scheduling algorithms, there has been comparatively little work investigating what the scheduling algorithms can or should know about the queries to be scheduled. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of using histograms describing the distribution of likely query execution times as input to the query scheduler. We propose a novel distribution-based scheduling algorithm, Shepherd, and show that Shepherd substantially outperforms state-of-the-art point-based methods through extensive experimentation with both synthetic and TPC workloads.

<div class="paper_content"><p>The Big Data era is upon us: data is being generated, collected and analyzed at an unprecedented scale, and data-driven decision making is sweeping through all aspects of society. Since the value of data explodes when it can be linked and fused with other data, addressing the big data integration (BDI) challenge is critical to realizing the promise of Big Data. DI differs from traditional data integration in many dimensions: (i) the number of data sources, even for a single domain, has grown to be in the tens of thousands, (ii) many of the data sources are very dynamic, as a huge amount of newly collected data are continuously made available, (iii) the data sources are extremely heterogeneous in their structure, with considerable variety even for substantially similar entities, and (iv) the data sources are of widely differing qualities, with significant differences in the coverage, accuracy and timeliness of data provided. This tutorial explores the progress that has been made by the data integration community on the topics of schema mapping, record linkage and data fusion in addressing these novel challenges faced by big data integration, and identifies a range of open problems for the community.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>We study the problem of computing shortest path or distance between two query vertices in a graph, which has numerous important applications. Quite a number of indexes have been proposed to answer such distance queries. However, all of these indexes can only process graphs of size barely up to 1 million vertices, which is rather small in view of many of the fast-growing real-world graphs today such as social networks and Web graphs. We propose an efficient index, which is a novel labeling scheme based on the independent set of a graph. We show that our method can handle graphs of size orders of magnitude larger than existing indexes.</p></div>

<p>Dayu Yuan (Penn State University), Prasenjit Mitra (Penn State University), C. Lee Giles (Penn State University)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>We study supergraph search (SPS), that is, given a query graph q and a graph database G that contains a collection of graphs , return graphs that have q as a supergraph from G. SPS has broad appli- cations in bioinformatics, cheminformatics and other scientific and commercial fields. Determining whether a graph is a subgraph (or supergraph) of another is an NP-complete problem. Hence, it is in- tractable to compute SPS for large graph databases. Two separate indexing methods, a “filter + verify”-based method and a “prefix- sharing”-based method, have been studied to efficiently compute SPS. To implement the above two methods, subgraph patterns are mined from the graph database to build an index. Those subgraphs are mined to optimize either the filtering gain or the prefix-sharing gain. However, no single subgraph-mining algorithm considers both gains.
This work is the first one to mine subgraphs to optimize both the filtering gain and the prefix-sharing gain while processing SPS queries. First, we show that the subgraph-mining problem is NP- hard. Then, we propose two polynomial-time algorithms to solve the problem with an approximation ratio of 1−1/e and 1/4 respec- tively. In addition, we construct a lattice-like index, LW-index, to organize the selected subgraph patterns for fast index-lookup. Our experiments show that our approach improves the query processing time for SPS queries by a factor of 3 to 10.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>It is increasingly common to find real-life data represented as networks of labeled, heterogeneous entities. To query these networks, one often needs to identify the matches of a given query graph in a (typically large) network modeled as a target graph. Due to noise and the lack of fixed schema in the target graph, the query graph can substantially differ from its matches in the target graph in both structure and node labels, thus bringing challenges to the graph querying tasks. In this paper, we propose NeMa (Network Match), a neighborhood-based subgraph matching technique for querying real-life networks. (1) To measure the quality of the match, we propose a novel subgraph matching cost metric that aggregates the costs of matching individual nodes, and unifies both structure and node label similarities. (2) Based on the metric, we formulate the minimum cost subgraph matching problem. Given a query graph and a target graph, the problem is to identify the (top-k) matches of the query graph with minimum costs in the target graph. We show that the problem is NP-hard, and also hard to approximate. (3) We propose a heuristic algorithm for solving the problem based on an inference model. In addition, we propose optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of our method.

<div class="paper_content"><p>	Much work has been devoted to supporting RDF data. But state-of-the-art systems and methods still cannot handle web scale RDF data effectively. Furthermore, many useful and general purpose graph-based operations (e.g., random walk, reachability, community discovery) on RDF data are not supported, as most existing systems store and index data in particular ways (e.g., as relational tables or as a bitmap matrix) to maximize one particular operation on RDF data: SPARQL query processing. In this paper, we introduce Trinity.RDF, a distributed, memory-based graph engine for web scale RDF data. Instead of managing the RDF data in triple stores or as bitmap matrices, we store RDF data in its native graph form. It achieves much better (sometimes orders of magnitude better) performance for SPARQL queries than the state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, since the data is stored in its native graph form, the system can support other operations (e.g., random walks, reachability) on RDF graphs as well. We conduct comprehensive experimental studies on real life, web scale RDF data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>It is quite common for networks emerging nowadays to have labels or textual contents on the nodes. On such networks, we study the problem of top-k nearest keyword (k-NK) search. In a network G modeled as an undirected graph, each node is attached with zero or more keywords, and each edge is assigned with a weight measuring its length. Given a query node q in G and a keyword lambda, a k-NK query seeks k nodes which contain lambda and are nearest to q. k-NK is not only useful as a stand-alone query but also as a building block for tackling complex graph pattern matching problems. 

The key to an accurate k-NK result is a precise shortest distance estimation in a graph. Based on the latest distance oracle technique, we build a shortest path tree for a distance oracle and use the tree distance as a more accurate estimation. With such representation, the original k-NK query on a graph can be reduced to answering the query on a set of trees and then assembling the results obtained from the trees. We propose two efficient algorithms to report the exact k-NK result on a tree. One is query time optimized for a scenario when a small number of result nodes are of interest to users. The other handles k-NK queries for an arbitrarily large k efficiently. In obtaining a k-NK result on a graph from that on trees, a global storage technique is proposed to further reduce the index size and the query time. Extensive experimental results conform with our theoretical findings, and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our k-NK algorithms on large real graphs.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Large-scale, distributed database systems often store critical business data and have stringent availability requirements. We introduce a protocol for schema evolution in these systems that is asynchronous --it allows different servers in the database system to transition to a new schema at different times --and online --all servers can access and update all data during a schema change. We provide a formal model for determining the correctness of schema changes under these conditions, and we demonstrate that many common schema changes can cause anomalies and database corruption. We avoid these problems by replacing corruption-causing schema changes with a sequence of schema changes that is guaranteed to avoid corrupting the database so long as all servers are no more than one schema version behind at any time. Finally, we discuss a practical implementation of our protocol in F1, the    database system which stores data for Google AdWords.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Search, exploration and social experience on the Web has re- cently undergone tremendous changes with search engines, web portals and social networks offering a different perspec- tive on information discovery and consumption. This new perspective is aimed at capturing user intents, and providing richer and highly connected experiences. The new battle- ground revolves around technologies for the ingestion, dis- ambiguation and enrichment of entities from a variety of structured and unstructured data sources – we refer to this process as knowledge base synthesis. This paper presents the design, implementation and production deployment of the Web Of Objects (WOO) system, a Hadoop-based plat- form tackling such challenges. WOO has been designed and implemented to enable various products in Yahoo! to syn- thesize knowledge bases (KBs) of entities relevant to their domains. Currently, the implementation of WOO we de- scribe is used by various Yahoo! properties such as Intonow, Yahoo! Local, Yahoo! Events and Yahoo! Search. This pa- per highlights: (i) challenges that arise in designing, build- ing and operating a platform that handles multi-domain, multi-version, and multi-tenant disambiguation of web-scale knowledge bases (hundreds of millions of entities), (ii) the architecture and technical solutions we devised, and (iii) an evaluation on real-world production datasets.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Many applications that process social data, such as tweets,  must extract entities from tweets (e.g., “Obama” and “Hawaii”  in “Obama went to Hawaii”), link them to entities in a  knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia), classify tweets into a set  of predefined topics, and assign descriptive tags to tweets.  Few solutions exist today to solve these problems for social  data, and they are limited in important ways. Further, even  though several industrial systems such as OpenCalais have  been deployed to solve these problems for text data, little if  any has been published about them, and it is unclear if any  of the systems has been tailored for social media.  In this paper we describe in depth an end-to-end industrial  system that solves these problems for social data. The  system has been developed and used heavily in the past  three years, first at Kosmix, a startup, and later at WalmartLabs.  We show how our system uses a Wikipedia-based  global “real-time” knowledge base that is well suited for social  data, how we interleave the tasks in a synergistic fashion,  how we generate and use contexts and social signals  to improve task accuracy, and how we scale the system to  the entire Twitter firehose. We describe experiments that  show that our system outperforms current approaches. Finally  we describe applications of the system at Kosmix and  WalmartLabs, and lessons learned.</p></div>

Unicorn is based on standard concepts in information retrieval, but it includes features to promote results with good social proximity. It also supports queries that require multiple round-trips to leaves in order to retrieve objects that are more than one edge away from source nodes. Unicorn is designed to answer billions of queries per day at latencies in the hundreds of milliseconds, and it serves as an infrastructural building block for Facebook's Graph Search product.

<div class="paper_content"><p>The popularity of social-networking sites has increased rapidly over the last decade. One of the most fundamental functionalities of social-networking sites is to present users with streams of events shared by their friends.
At a systems level, materialized per-user views are a common way to assemble and deliver such event streams on-line and with low latency. Access to the data stores, which keep the user views, is a major bottleneck of social-networking systems.
We propose improving the throughput of a system by using social piggybacking: process the requests of two friends by querying and updating the view of a third common friend.
By using one such hub view, the system can serve requests of the first friend without querying or updating the view of the second. We show that, given a social graph, social piggybacking can minimize the overall number of requests, but computing the optimal set of hubs is an NP-hard problem. We propose an O(log(n)) approximation algorithm and a heuristic to solve the problem, and evaluate them using the full Twitter and Flickr social graphs, which have up to billions of edges. Compared to existing approaches, using social piggybacking results in similar throughput in systems with few servers, but enables substantial throughput improvements as the size of the system grows, reaching up to a 2-factor increase. We also evaluate our algorithms on a real social-networking system prototype and we show that the actual increase in throughput corresponds nicely to the gain anticipated by our cost function.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Recent research has shown that crowd sourcing can be used effectively to solve problems that are difficult for computers, e.g., optical character recognition and identification of the structural configuration of natural proteins. 
In this paper we propose to use the power of the crowd to address yet another difficult problem that frequently occurs in a daily life - answering planning queries whose output is a sequence of objects/actions, when the goal, i.e, the notion of "best output", is hard to formalize. For example,
planning the sequence of places/attractions to visit in the course of a vacation, where the goal is to enjoy the resulting vacation the most, or planning the sequence of courses to take in an academic schedule planning, where the goal is to obtain solid knowledge of a given subject domain. Such goals may be easily understandable by humans, but hard or even impossible to formalize for a computer.

We present a novel algorithm for efficiently harnessing the crowd to assist in answering such planning queries. The algorithm builds the desired plans incrementally, choosing at each step the 'best' questions so that the overall number of questions that need to be asked is minimized. We prove the algorithm to be optimal within its class and demonstrate experimentally its effectiveness and efficiency.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Deco is a comprehensive system for answering declarative queries posed over stored relational data together with data obtained on-demand from the crowd. In this paper we describe Deco's cost-based query optimizer, building on Deco's data model, query language, and query execution engine presented earlier. Deco's objective in query optimization is to find the best query plan to answer a query, in terms of estimated monetary cost. Deco's query semantics and plan execution strategies require several fundamental changes to traditional query optimization. Novel techniques incorporated into Deco's query optimizer include a cost model distinguishing between "free" existing data versus paid new data, a cardinality estimation algorithm coping with changes to the database state during query execution, and a plan enumeration algorithm maximizing reuse of common subplans in a setting that makes reuse challenging. We experimentally evaluate Deco's query optimizer, focusing on the accuracy of cost estimation and the efficiency of plan enumeration.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>In this paper, we address the problem of selectivity estimation in a
crowdsourced database.  Specifically, we develop several techniques
for using workers on a crowdsourcing platform like Amazon's Mechanical
Turk to estimate the fraction of items in a dataset (e.g., a
collection of photos) that satisfy some property or predicate (e.g.,
photos of trees).  We do this without explicitly iterating through
every item in the dataset.  This is important in crowdsourced query
optimization to support predicate ordering and in query evaluation,
when performing a GROUP BY operation with a COUNT or AVG aggregate.
We compare sampling item labels, a traditional approach, to showing
workers a collection of items and asking them to estimate how many
satisfy some predicate.  Additionally, we develop techniques to
eliminate spammers and colluding attackers trying to skew selectivity
estimates when using this count estimation approach.  We find that for
images, counting can be much more effective than sampled labeling,
reducing the amount of work necessary to arrive at an estimate that is
within 1% of the true fraction by up to an order of magnitude, with
lower worker latency.  We also find that sampled labeling outperforms
count estimation on a text processing task, presumably because people
are better at quickly processing large batches of images than they are
at reading strings of text.  Our spammer detection technique, which is
applicable to both the label- and count-based approaches, can improve
accuracy by up to two orders of magnitude.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>We study the problem of enhancing Entity Resolution (ER) with the help of crowdsourcing. ER is the problem of clustering records that refer to the same real-world entity and can be an extremely difficult process for computer algorithms alone. For example, figuring out which images refer to the same person can be a hard task for computers, but an easy one for humans. We study the problem of  resolving records with crowdsourcing where we ask questions to humans in order to guide ER into producing accurate results. Since human work is costly, our goal is to ask as few questions as possible. We propose a  probabilistic framework for ER that can be used to estimate how much ER accuracy we obtain by asking each question and select the best question with the highest expected accuracy. Computing the expected accuracy is NP-hard, so we propose approximation techniques for efficient computation. We evaluate our best question algorithms on real and synthetic datasets and demonstrate how we can obtain high ER accuracy while significantly reducing the number of questions asked to humans. </p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Advances in operating system and storage-level virtualization technologies have enabled the effective consolidation of heterogeneous applications in a shared cloud infrastructure. Novel research challenges arising from this new shared environment, include load balancing, workload estimation, resource isolation, machine replication, live migration, and an emergent need of automation to handle large scale operations with minimal manual intervention. Given that databases are at the core of most applications that are deployed in the cloud, database management systems (DBMSs) represent a very important technology component that needs to be virtualized in order to realize the beneﬁts of virtualization from autonomic management of data-intensive applications in large scale data-centers. This tutorial is organized in three parts. In part one, we provide a general background of the current state-of-the-art of virtualization technologies on modern cloud environment in particular, covering in depth some crucial advances. In part two, we explore consolidated shared storage systems and virtualization techniques used to ensure fair access between applications. For part three, we focus on some of the shortcomings of general purpose operating systems and storage-level virtualization technologies when applied to DBMSs and discuss recent research and development in this space. We will touch on several open problems, providing pointers to areas of research we expect to be growing and for which simple naive solutions are not likely to be very effective. The goal of this tutorial is to survey the techniques used in providing elasticity in virtual machine systems, shared storage systems, and survey database research on multitenant architectures and elasticity primitives. This foundation of core Database as a Service advances, together with a primer of important related topics in OS and storage-level virtualization, are central for anyone that wants to operate in this area of research. At the end of the tutorial we expect attendees to be well oriented in this exciting research area and ready to participate in it.</p></div>

<p>Marina Drosou (University of Ioannina), Evaggelia Pitoura (University of Ioannina)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Recently, result diversification has attracted a lot of attention as a means to improve the quality of results retrieved by user queries. In this paper, we propose a new, intuitive definition of diversity called DisC diversity. A DisC diverse subset of a query result contains objects such that each object in the result is represented by a similar object in the diverse subset and the objects in the diverse subset are dissimilar to each other. We show that locating a minimum DisC diverse subset is an NP-hard problem and provide heuristics for its approximation. We also propose adapting DisC diverse subsets to a different degree of diversification. We call this operation zooming. We present efficient implementations of our algorithms based on the M-tree, a spatial index structure, and experimentally evaluate their performance.</p></div>

<p>Rajeev Gupta (IBM Research - India), Krithi Ramamritham (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay), Mukesh Mohania (IBM Research - India)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Continuous aggregation queries over dynamic data are used for real time decision making and timely business intelligence. In this paper we consider queries where a client wants to be notified if the ratio of two aggregates over distributed data crosses a specified threshold. Consider these scenarios: a mechanism designed to defend against distributed denial of service attacks may be triggered when the fraction of packets arriving to a subnet is more than 5% of the total packets; or a distributed store chain withdrws its discount on luxury goods when sales of luxury goods constitute more than 20% of the overall sales. The challenge in executing such ratio threshold queries (RTQs) lies in incurring the minimal amount of communication necessary for propagation of updates from data sources to the aggregator node where the client query is executed.We address this challenge by proposing schemes for converting the client ratio threshold condition into conditions on individual distributed data sources. Whenever the condition associated with a source  is violated, the source pushes its data values to the aggregator, which in turn pulls data values from other sources to determine whether the client threshold condition is indeed violated. We present algorithms to minimize the number of source condition violations (i.e., the number of pushes) while ensuring that no violation of the client threshold condition is missed. Further, in case of a source condition violation, we propose efficient selective pulling  algorithms for intelligently choosing additional sources whose data should be pulled by the aggregator. Using performance evaluation on synthetic and real traces of data updates we show that our algorithms result in up to an order of magnitude less number of messages compared to existing approaches in the literature.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>The ability to reason about changes in a distributed system’s state enables network administrators to better diagnose protocol misconfigurations, detect intrusions, and pinpoint performance bottlenecks. We propose a novel provenance model called Distributed Time-aware Provenance (DTaP) that aids distributed system forensics and debugging by explicitly representing time, distributed state, and state changes. Using a distributed Datalog abstraction for modeling distributed protocols, we prove that the DTaP model provides a sound and complete representation that correctly captures dependencies among events in a distributed system. We additionally introduce DistTape, an implementation of the DTaP model that uses novel distributed storage structures, query processing, and cost-based optimization techniques to efficiently query time-aware provenance in a distributed setting. Using two example systems (declarative network routing and Hadoop MapReduce), we demonstrate that DistTape can efficiently maintain and query time-aware provenance at low communication and computation cost.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>The volume of RDF data continues to grow over the past decade and many known RDF datasets have billions of triples. A grant challenge of managing this huge RDF data is how to access this big RDF data efficiently. A popular approach to addressing the problem is to build a full set of permutations of (S, P, O) indexes. Although this approach has shown to accelerate joins by orders of magnitude, the large space overhead limits the scalability of this approach and makes it heavyweight. In this paper, we present TripleBit, a fast and compact system for storing and accessing RDF data. The design of TripleBit has three salient features. First, the compact design of TripleBit reduces both the size of stored RDF data and the size of its indexes. Second, TripleBit introduces two auxiliary index structures, ID-Chunk bit matrix and ID-Predicate bit matrix, to minimize the cost of index selection during query evaluation. Third, its query processor dynamically generates an optimal execution ordering for join queries, leading to fast query execution and effective reduction on the size of intermediate results. Our experiments show that TripleBit outperforms RDF-3X, MonetDB, BitMat on LUBM, UniProt and BTC 2012 benchmark queries and it offers orders of mangnitude performance improvement for some complex join queries.

<div class="paper_content"><p>We present an unsupervised approach for harvesting the data exposed by a set of structured and partially overlapping data-intensive web sources. Our proposal comes within a formal framework tackling two problems: the data extraction problem, to generate extraction rules based on the input websites, and the data integration problem, to integrate the extracted data in a unified schema. We introduce an original algorithm, Weir, to solve the stated problems and formally prove its correctness. Weir leverages the overlapping data among sources to make better decisions both in the data extraction (by pruning rules that do not lead to redundant information) and in the data integration (by reflecting local properties of a source over the mediated schema). Along the way, we characterize the amount of redundancy needed by our algorithm to produce a solution, and present experimental results to show the benefits of our approach with respect to existing solutions.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Support of high performance queries on large volumes of spatial data becomes increasingly important in many application domains, including geospatial problems in numerous fields, location based services, and emerging scientific applications that are increasingly data- and compute-intensive. The emergence of massive scale spatial data is due to the proliferation of cost effective and ubiquitous positioning technologies, development of high resolution imaging technologies, or contribution from a large number of community users. There are two major challenges for managing and querying massive spatial data to support spatial queries: the explosion of spatial data, and the high computational complexity of spatial queries. In this paper, we present Hadoop-GIS -- a scalable and high performance spatial data warehousing system for running large scale spatial queries on Hadoop. Hadoop-GIS supports multiple types of spatial queries on MapReduce through space partitioning, customizable spatial query engine RESQUE, implicit parallel spatial query execution on MapReduce, and effective methods for amending query results through handling boundary objects on MapReduce. Hadoop-GIS takes advantage of global partition indexing and customizable on demand local spatial indexing to achieve efficient query processing. Hadoop-GIS is integrated into Hive to support declarative spatial queries with an integrated architecture. Our experiments have demonstrated the high efficiency of Hadoop-GIS on query response and high scalability to run on commodity clusters. Comparative experiments have shown that Hadoop-GIS has close performance to parallel SDBMS and outperforms SDBMS for compute-intensive queries, and comes with much flexibility on query optimization and is highly cost effective. The system has been deployed or tested for multiple real world applications, and is available as a set of library for processing spatial queries, and as an integrated software package with Hive.</p></div>

<p>Bhuvan Bamba (Oracle America Inc.), Siva Ravada (Oracle America Inc.), Ying Hu (Oracle America Inc.), Richard Anderson (Oracle America Inc.)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Oracle Spatial and Graph is a geographic information system (GIS) which provides users the ability to store spatial data alongside conventional data in Oracle. As a result of the coexistence of spatial and other data, we observe a trend towards users performing increasingly complex queries which involve spatial as well as non-spatial predicates. Accurate selectivity values, especially for queries with multiple predicates requiring joins among numerous tables, are essential for the database optimizer to determine a good execution plan. For queries involving spatial predicates, this requires that reasonably accurate statistics collection has been performed on the spatial data. For extensible data cartridges such as Oracle Spatial and Graph, the optimizer expects to receive accurate predicate selectivity and cost values from functions implemented within the data cartridge. Although statistics collection for spatial data has been researched in academia for a few years; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to present spatial statistics collection implementation details for a commercial GIS database. In this paper, we describe our experiences with implementation of statistics collection methods for complex geometry objects within Oracle Spatial and Graph. Firstly, we exemplify issues with previous partitioning-based algorithms in presence of complex geometry objects and suggest enhancements which resolve the issues. Secondly, we propose a main memory implementation which not only speeds up the disk-based partitioning algorithms but also utilizes existing R-tree indexes to provide surprisingly accurate selectivity estimates. Last but not the least, we provide extensive experimental results and an example study which displays the efficacy of our approach on Oracle query performance.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Facebook takes performance monitoring seriously. Any issues can impact over a billion users so we track thousands of servers, hundreds of PB of daily network traffic, hundreds of daily code changes, and many other metrics. We require latencies of about a minute from events occuring (a client request on a phone, a bug report filed, a code change checked in) to graphs showing those events on developers’ monitors.  Scuba is the data management system Facebook uses for most real-time analysis. Scuba is a fast, scalable, distributed, in-memory database built at Facebook. It currently ingests millions of rows (events) per second and expires data at the same rate. Scuba stores data completely in memory on hundreds of servers each with 144 GB RAM. To process each query, Scuba aggregates data from all servers. Scuba processes almost a million queries per day. Scuba is used extensively for interactive, ad hoc, analysis queries that run in under a second over live data. In addition, Scuba is the workhorse behind Facebook’s code regression analysis, bug report monitoring, ads revenue monitoring, and performance debugging.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>This paper showcases some of the newly introduced parallel execution methods in Oracle RDBMS. These methods provide highly scalable and adaptive parallel evaluation for the most commonly used SQL operations – joins, group-by, rollup/cube, grouping sets, and analytic window functions. The novelty of these techniques is their use of multi-stage parallelization models, accommodation of optimizer mistakes, and the runtime parallelization and data distribution decisions. These parallel plans adapt based on the statistics gathered on the real data at query execution time. We realized enormous performance gains from these novel parallelization techniques. The paper also discusses our approach to parallelize queries with operations that are inherently serial. We believe all these techniques will make their way into big data analytics and other massively parallel database systems.</p></div>

<p>Samuel Madden, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>In this talk, I will describe a new system we are building at MIT, called DataHub. DataHub is a hosted interactive data processing, sharing, and visualization system for large-scale data analytics. Key features of DataHub include: (i) Flexible ingest and data cleaning tools to help massage data into a form that users can write programs that operate on it. This includes both removing irregularity as well as exposing structure from unstructured data such as text files and images. (ii) A scalable, parallel, SQL-based analytic data processing engine optimized for extremely low-latency operation on large data sets, by exploiting massive parallelism available in modern GPUs and upcoming “manycore” CPUs. (iii) An interactive visualization system that is tightly coupled to the data processing and lineage engine. Specifically, DataHub provides a workflow-based visualization engine where users can choose from a library of pre-built visualizations, or define their own visualizations via a simple API. Analysis and visualization steps may run on either CPUs or manycore/GPU devices. (iv) Finally, Datahub is a hosted data platform, designed to eliminate the need for users to manage their own database. It includes features that allow users to selectively share their data with other users, using complex context-sensitive predicates (e.g., that data about particular times or location should be visible to particular users).</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>In the context of extracting value to users from the available data, the database community has historically been focusing on efficient processing of primarily structured queries posed by expert users mostly on structured, pre-organized data. The rather recent “Big-Data” phenomenon has been shaping a world where extreme quantities of data are collected in an ad-hoc, almost accidental, way. Further, the user targets for Big Data are broader than those traditionally considered by the database-research community. The main goals of this panel are to identify the pain points when end users attempt to extract real value from ad hoc collections of Big Data, and to provide alternative viewpoints on what the database community should work on, if it is to play a bigger role in bringing the benefits of Big Data to the masses. </p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Advances in operating system and storage-level virtualization technologies have enabled the effective consolidation of heterogeneous applications in a shared cloud infrastructure. Novel research challenges arising from this new shared environment, include load balancing, workload estimation, resource isolation, machine replication, live migration, and an emergent need of automation to handle large scale operations with minimal manual intervention. Given that databases are at the core of most applications that are deployed in the cloud, database management systems (DBMSs) represent a very important technology component that needs to be virtualized in order to realize the beneﬁts of virtualization from autonomic management of data-intensive applications in large scale data-centers. This tutorial is organized in three parts. In part one, we provide a general background of the current state-of-the-art of virtualization technologies on modern cloud environment in particular, covering in depth some crucial advances. In part two, we explore consolidated shared storage systems and virtualization techniques used to ensure fair access between applications. For part three, we focus on some of the shortcomings of general purpose operating systems and storage-level virtualization technologies when applied to DBMSs and discuss recent research and development in this space. We will touch on several open problems, providing pointers to areas of research we expect to be growing and for which simple naive solutions are not likely to be very effective. The goal of this tutorial is to survey the techniques used in providing elasticity in virtual machine systems, shared storage systems, and survey database research on multitenant architectures and elasticity primitives. This foundation of core Database as a Service advances, together with a primer of important related topics in OS and storage-level virtualization, are central for anyone that wants to operate in this area of research. At the end of the tutorial we expect attendees to be well oriented in this exciting research area and ready to participate in it.</p></div>

<p>Phokion Kolaitis (UC Santa Cruz &amp; IBM Research - Almaden), Enela Pema (UC Santa Cruz), Wang-Chiew Tan (UC Santa Cruz)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>An inconsistent database is a database that violates one or more integrity constraints. A typical approach for answering a query over an inconsistent database is to first clean the inconsistent database by transforming it to a consistent one and then apply the query to the consistent database. An alternative and more principled approach, known as consistent query answering, derives the answers to a query over an inconsistent database without changing the database, but by taking into account all possible repairs of the database.

In this paper, we study the problem of consistent query answering over inconsistent databases for the class for conjunctive queries under primary key constraints. We develop a system, called EQUIP, that represents a fundamental departure from existing approaches for computing the consistent answers to queries in this class. At the heart of EQUIP is a technique, based on Binary Integer Programming (BIP), that repeatedly searches for repairs to eliminate candidate consistent answers until no further such candidates can be eliminated. We establish rigorously the correctness of the algorithms behind EQUIP and carry out an extensive experimental investigation that validates the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, EQUIP exhibits good and stable performance on conjunctive queries under primary key constraints, it significantly outperforms existing systems for computing the consistent answers of such queries in the case in which the consistent answers are not first-order rewritable, and it scales well.</p></div>

<p>Sourav Dutta (Max Planck Institute for Informatics), Ankur Narang (IBM Research - India), Suman K. Bera (IBM Research - India)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>The unparalleled growth and popularity of the Internet coupled with the advent of diverse modern applications such as search engines, on-line transactions, climate warning systems, etc., has catered to an unprecedented expanse in the volume of data stored world-wide. Efficient storage, management, and processing of such massively exponential amount of data has emerged as a central theme of research in this direction. Detection and removal of redundancies and duplicates in real-time from such multi-trillion record-set to bolster resource and compute efficiency constitutes a challenging area of study. The infeasibility of storing the entire data from potentially unbounded data streams, with the need for precise elimination of duplicates calls for intelligent approximate duplicate detection algorithms. The literature hosts numerous works based on the well-known probabilistic bitmap structure, Bloom Filter and its variants.

In this paper we propose a novel data structure, Streaming Quotient Filter, (SQF) for efficient detection and removal of duplicates in data streams. SQF intelligently stores the signatures of elements arriving on a data stream, and along with an eviction policy provides near zero false positive and false negative rates. We show that the near optimal performance of SQF is achieved with a very low memory requirement, making it ideal for real-time memory-efficient de-duplication applications having an extremely low false positive and false negative tolerance rates. We present detailed theoretical analysis of the working of SQF, providing a guarantee on its performance. Empirically, we compare SQF to alternate methods and show that the proposed method is superior in terms of memory and accuracy compared to the existing solutions. We also discuss Dynamic SQF for evolving streams and the parallel implementation of SQF.</p></div>

<p>Flip Korn (AT&amp;T Labs-Research), Barna Saha (AT&amp;T Labs-Research), Divesh Srivastava (AT&amp;T Labs-Research), Shanshan Ying (National University of Singapore)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Semi-structured data such as XML are popular for data interchange and storage.
However, many XML documents have improper nesting where open- and close-tags
are unmatched.
Since some semi-structured data (e.g., Latex) have a flexible grammar
and since many XML documents lack an accompanying DTD or XSD,
we focus on computing a syntactic repair via the edit distance.

To solve this problem, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm
which takes cubic time. While this algorithm is not scalable,
well-formed substrings of the data can be pruned to enable faster
computation. Unfortunately, there are still cases where the dynamic
program could be very expensive; hence, we give branch-and-bound
algorithms based on various combinations of two heuristics,
called MinCost and MaxBenefit, that trade off between accuracy and
efficiency.
Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the performance
of these algorithms on real data.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Data-cleaning (or data-repairing) is considered a crucial problem in many database-related tasks. It consists in making a database consistent with respect to a set of given constraints. In recent years, repairing methods have been proposed for several classes of constraints. However, these methods rely on ad hoc decisions and tend to hard-code the strategy to repair conflicting values. As a consequence, there is currently no general algorithm to solve database repairing problems that involve different kinds of constraints and different strategies to select preferred values. In this paper we develop a uniform framework to solve this problem. We propose a new semantics for repairs, and a chase-based algorithm to compute minimal solutions. We implemented the framework in a DBMS-based prototype, and we report experimental results that confirm its good scalability and superior quality in computing repairs. </p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>The amount of useful information available on theWeb has been growing at a dramatic pace in recent years and people rely more and more on theWeb to fulfill their information needs. In this paper, we study truthfulness of Deep Web data in two domains where we believed data are fairly clean and data quality is important to people’s lives: Stock and Flight. To our surprise, we observed a large amount of inconsistency on data from different sources and also some sources with quite low accuracy. We further applied on these two data sets state-of-the-art data fusion methods that aim at resolving conflicts and finding the truths, analyzed their promise and limitations, and suggested possible improvements. We wish our study can increase awareness of the seriousness of conflicting data on theWeb and in turn inspire more research in our community to tackle this problem.</p></div>

<p>Georgios Kellaris (HKUST), Stavros Papadopoulos (HKUST)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>We address one-time publishing of non-overlapping counts with e-differential privacy. These statistics are useful in a wide and important range of applications, including transactional, traffic and medical data analysis. Prior work on the topic publishes such statistics with prohibitively low utility in several practical scenarios. Towards this end, we present GS, a method that pre-processes the counts by elaborately grouping and smoothing them via averaging. This step acts as a form of preliminary perturbation that diminishes sensitivity, and enables GS to achieve e-differential privacy through low Laplace noise injection. The grouping strategy is dictated by a sampling mechanism, which minimizes the smoothing perturbation. We demonstrate the superiority of GS over its competitors, and confirm its practicality, via extensive experiments on real datasets.</p></div>

<p>Chen Zeng (University of Wisconsin-Madison), Jeffrey Naughton (University of Wisconsin-Madison), Jin-yi Cai (University of Wisconsin-Madison)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>We consider differentially private frequent itemset mining. We begin
by exploring the theoretical difficulty of simultaneously providing
good utility and good privacy in this task.  While our analysis proves
that in general this is very difficult, it leaves a glimmer of hope in
that our proof of difficulty relies on the existence of long
transactions (that is, transactions containing many items).
Accordingly, we investigate an approach that begins by truncating long
transactions, trading off errors introduced by the truncation with
those introduced by the noise added to guarantee privacy. Experimental
results over standard benchmark databases show that truncating is
indeed effective.  Our algorithm solves the ``classical'' frequent
itemset mining problem, in which the goal is to find all itemsets
whose support exceeds a threshold. Related work has proposed
differentially private algorithms for the top-k itemset mining
problem (``find the k most frequent itemsets''.) An experimental
comparison with those algorithms show that our algorithm achieves better F-score
unless k is small.</p></div>

<p>Stephen Tu (MIT), Frans Kaashoek (MIT), Sam Madden (MIT), Nickolai Zeldovich (MIT)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Monomi is a system for securely executing analytical workloads over sensitive data on an untrusted database server. Monomi works by encrypting the entire database and running queries over the encrypted data. Monomi introduces split client/server query execution, which can execute arbitrarily complex queries over encrypted data, as well as several techniques that improve performance for such workloads, including per-row precomputation, space-efficient encryption, grouped homomorphic addition, and pre-filtering. Since these optimizations are good for some queries but not others, Monomi introduces a designer for choosing an efficient physical design at the server for a given workload, and a planner to choose an efficient execution plan for a given query at runtime. A prototype of Monomi running on top of Postgres can execute most of the queries from the TPC-H benchmark with a median overhead of only 1.24x (ranging from 1.03x to 2.33x) compared to an un-encrypted Postgres database where a compromised server would reveal all data.</p></div>

<p>Sumeet Bajaj (Stony Brook University), Radu Sion (Stony Brook University)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Clients of outsourced databases need Query Authentication (QA) guaranteeing the integrity (correctness and completeness),
and authenticity of the query results returned by potentially
compromised providers.

Existing results provide QA assurances for a limited class
of queries by deploying several software cryptographic constructs.
Here, we show that, to achieve QA, however, it is significantly cheaper and more practical to deploy server-hosted, tamper-proof co-processors, despite their higher acquisition
costs. Further, this provides the ability to handle arbitrary queries.

To reach this insight, we extensively survey existing QA
work and identify interdependencies and efficiency relationships.
We then introduce CorrectDB, a new DBMS with full QA assurances, leveraging server-hosted, tamper-proof, trusted hardware in close proximity to the outsourced data.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Peer Data Management Systems (PDMS) are an attractive solution
for managing distributed heterogeneous information. When
a peer (client) requests data from another peer (server) with a different
schema, translations of the query and its answer are done by
a sequence of intermediate peers (translators). There are two privacy
issues in this P2P data integration process: (i) answer privacy:
no unauthorized parties (including the translators) should learn the
query result; (ii) mapping privacy: the schema and the value mappings
used by the translators to perform the translation should not
be revealed to other peers. Elmeleegy and Ouzzani proposed the
PPP protocol that is the first to support privacy-preserving querying
in PDMS. However, PPP suffers from several shortcomings. First,
PPP does not satisfy the requirement of answer privacy, because it
is based on commutative encryption; we show that this issue can be
fixed by adopting another cryptographic technique called oblivious
transfer. Second, PPP adopts a weaker notion for mapping privacy,
which allows the client peer to observe certain mappings done by
translators. In this paper, we develop a lightweight protocol, which
satisfies mapping privacy and extend it to a more complex one that
facilitates parallel translation by peers. Furthermore, we consider
a stronger adversary model where there may be collusions among
peers and propose an efficient protocol that guards against collusions.
We conduct an experimental study on the performance of the
proposed protocols using both real and synthetic data. The results
show that the proposed protocols not only achieve a better privacy
guarantee than PPP, but they are also more efficient.</p></div>

into Real World Deployments</strong></h4>
<p>Daniel Abadi (Yale University)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Four years ago at VLDB 2009, a paper was published about a research
prototype, called HadoopDB, that attempted to transform Hadoop --- a
batch-oriented scalable system designed for processing unstructured data ---
into a full-fledged parallel database system that can achieve real-time
(interactive) query responses across both structured and unstructured data.
In 2010 it was commercialized by Hadapt, a start-up that was formed to
accelerate the engineering of the HadoopDB ideas, and to harden the codebase
for deployment in real-world, mission-critical applications.
In this talk I will give an overview of HadoopDB, and how it combines ideas
from the Hadoop and database system communities. I will then describe how
the project transitioned from a research prototype written by PhD students
at Yale University into enterprise-ready software written by a team of
experienced engineers. We will examine particular technical features that
are required in enterprise Hadoop deployments, and technical challenges that
we ran into while making HadoopDB robust enough to be deployed in the real
world. The talk will conclude with an analysis of how starting a company
impacts the tenure process, and some thoughts for graduate students and
junior faculty considering a similar path.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Graphs have been widely used to model complex data in many real-world applications. Answering vertex join queries over large graphs is meaningful and interesting, which can benefit friend recommendation in social networks and link prediction, etc. In this paper, we adopt "SimRank" to evaluate the similarity of two vertices in a large graph because of its generality. Note that "SimRank" is purely structure dependent and it does not rely on the domain knowledge. Specifically, we define a SimRank-based join (SRJ) query to find all the vertex pairs satisfying the threshold in a data graph G. In order to reduce the search space, we propose an estimated shortest-path distance based upper bound for SimRank scores to prune unpromising vertex pairs. In the verification, we propose a novel index, called h-go cover, to efficiently compute the SimRank score of a single vertex pair. Given a graph G, we only materialize the SimRank scores of a small proportion of vertex pairs (called h-go covers), based on which, the SimRank score of any vertex pair can be computed easily. In order to handle large graphs, we extend our technique to the partition-based framework. Thorough theoretical analysis and extensive experiments over both real and synthetic datasets confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution.</p></div>

<p>Fanwei Zhu (Zhejiang Univ City College), Yuan Fang, Kevin Chang (UIUC), Jing Ying (Zhejiang Univ City College)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>As Personalized PageRank has been widely leveraged for ranking on a graph, the efficient computation of Personalized PageRank Vector (PPV) becomes a prominent issue. In this paper, we propose FastPPV, an approximate PPV computation algorithm that is incremental and accuracy-aware. Our approach hinges on a novel paradigm of scheduled approximation: the computation is partitioned and scheduled for processing in an ''organized'' way, such that we can gradually improve our PPV estimation in an incremental manner, and quantify the accuracy of our approximation at query time. Guided by this principle, we develop an efficient hub based realization, where we adopt the metric of hub-length to partition and schedule random walk tours so that the approximation error reduces exponentially over iterations. Furthermore, as tours are segmented by hubs, the shared substructures between different tours (around the same hub) can be reused to speed up query processing both within and across iterations. Finally, we evaluate FastPPV over two real-world graphs, and show that it not only significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines in both online and offline phrases, but also scale well on larger graphs. In particular, we are able to achieve near-constant time online query processing irrespective of the graph size.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>	Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies are revolutionizing genomics research. Billions of short reads generated at low costs can be assembled for reconstructing the whole genomes. Unfortunately, the large memory footprint of the existing de novo assembly algorithms makes it challenging to get the assembly done for higher eukaryotes like mammals. In this work, we investigate the memory issue of constructing de Bruijn graph, a core task in leading assembly algorithms, which often consumes several hundreds of gigabytes memory for large genomes. We propose a disk-based partition method, called Minimum Substring Partitioning (MSP), to complete the task using less than 10 gigabytes memory, without runtime slowdown. MSP breaks the short reads into multiple small disjoint partitions so that each partition can be loaded into memory, processed individually and later merged with others to form a de Bruijn graph. By leveraging the overlaps among the k-mers (substring of length k), MSP achieves astonishing compression ratio: The total size of partitions is reduced from Θ(kn) to Θ(n), where n is the size of the short read database, and k is the length of a k-mer. Experimental results show that our method can build de Bruijn graphs using a commodity computer for any large-volume sequence dataset.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Finding subgraph isomorphisms is an important problem in many applications which deal with data modeled as graphs. While this problem is NP-hard, in recent years, many algorithms have been proposed to solve it in a reasonable time for real datasets using different join orders, pruning rules, and auxiliary neighborhood information. However, since they have not been empirically compared one another in most research work, it is not clear whether the later work outperforms the earlier work. Another problem is that reported comparisons were often done using the original authors’binaries which were written in different programming environments. In this paper, we address these serious problems by re-implementing five state-of-the-art subgraph isomorphism algorithms in a common code base and by comparing them using many real-world datasets and their query loads. Through our in-depth analysis of experimental results, we report surprising empirical findings.</p></div>

<p>Feng Zhao (NUS), Anthony Tung (NUS)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Graphs are widely used in large scale social network analysis nowadays. Not only analysts need to focus on cohesive subgraphs to study patterns among social actors, but also normal users are interested in discovering what happening in their neighborhood. However, effectively storing large scale social network and efficiently identifying cohesive subgraphs is challenging. In this work we introduce a novel subgraph concept to capture the cohesion in social interactions, and propose an I/O efficient approach to discover cohesive subgraphs.

Besides, we propose an analytic system which allows users to perform intuitive, visual browsing on large scale social networks. Our system stores the network as a social graph in the graph database, retrieves a local cohesive subgraph based on the input keywords, and then hierarchically visualizes the subgraph out on orbital layout, in which more important social actors are located in the center. By summarizing textual interactions between social actors as tag cloud, we provide a way to quickly locate active social communities and their interactions in a unified view.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Designing scalable transaction processing systems on modern multicore hardware has been a challenge for almost a decade. The typical characteristics of transaction processing workloads lead to a high degree of unbounded communication on multicores for conventional system designs. In this tutorial, we initially present a systematic way of eliminating scalability bottlenecks of a transaction processing system, which is based on minimizing unbounded communication. Then, we show several techniques that apply the presented methodology to minimize logging, locking, latching etc. related bottlenecks of transaction processing systems. In parallel, we demonstrate the internals of the Shore-MT storage manager and how they have evolved over the years in terms of scalability on multicore hardware through such techniques. We also teach how to use Shore-MT with the various design options it offers through its sophisticated application layer Shore-Kits and simple Metadata Frontend.</p></div>

<p>Steffen Rendle, University of Konstanz</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>The most common approach in predictive modeling is to describe cases with feature vectors (aka design matrix). Many machine learning methods such as linear regression or support vector machines rely on this representation. However, when the underlying data has strong relational patterns, especially relations with high cardinality, the design matrix can get very large which can make learning and prediction slow or even infeasible.

This work solves this issue by making use of repeating patterns in the design matrix which stem from the underlying relational structure of the data. It is shown how coordinate descent learning and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference can be scaled for linear regression and factorization machine models. Empirically, it is shown on two large scale and very competitive datasets (Netflix prize, KDDCup 2012), that (1) standard learning algorithms based on the design matrix representation cannot scale to relational predictor variables, (2) the proposed new algorithms scale and (3) the predictive quality of the proposed generic feature-based approach is as good as the best specialized models that have been tailored to the respective tasks.</p></div>

<p>Eugene Wu (MIT), Sam Madden (MIT)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>A common way that users of database systems explore large data sets is to run aggregate queries that project the data down to a smaller number of points and dimensions that can then be visualized. Often, such visualizations will reveal outliers that correspond to errors or surprising features of the input data set. Unfortunately, databases and visualization systems do not provide a way to work backwards from an outlier point to the common properties of the (possibly many) unaggregated input tuples that correspond to that outlier. In this paper, we propose Scorpion, a system that, given a set of user-specified outlier points in an aggregate query result, identifies predicates that explain the outliers in terms of properties of the input tuples that are used to compute the selected outlier results. Specifically, we do this explanation by identifying predicates that, when applied to the input data, cause the outliers to disappear from the output. To find such predicates, we develop a notion of influence of a predicate on a given output, and design several algorithms that efficiently search for maximum influence predicates over the input data. We show that these algorithms can quickly find outliers in two real data sets (from a sensor deployment and a campaign finance data set), and run orders of magnitude faster than a naive search algorithm while providing comparable quality on a synthetic data set.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>	Association rule mining is known to be computationally intensive, yet real-time decision-making applications are increasingly intolerant to delays. To enable online association rule mining, existing techniques prestore intermediate results, namely, itemsets in an itemset-based index. However, given particular input parameter values such as minsupport and minconfidence, the actual rule generation must still be performed at query-time. The response time can be unacceptably long for interactive mining, especially when rule redundancy resolution is required as part of rule generation. To tackle this shortcoming, we introduce the parameter space model, called PARAS. PARAS enables fast rule mining by compactly maintaining the final rulesets instead of just storing intermediate itemsets. The PARAS model is based on the notion of stable region abstractions that form the coarse granularity ruleset space. Based on new insights on the redundancy relationships among rules, PARAS establishes a surprisingly compact representation of complex redundancy relationships while enabling efficient redundancy resolution at query-time. Besides the classical rule mining requests, this model supports three novel classes of exploratory queries. Using the proposed PSpace index, these exploratory query classes can all be answered with near real-time responsiveness. Our experimental evaluation using several benchmark datasets demonstrates that PARAS achieves 2-7 orders of magnitude improvement over commonly used techniques in online association rule mining.</p></div>

<p>Marco D. Adelfio (University of Maryland), Hanan Samet (University of Maryland)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Tabular data is an abundant source of information on the Web, but remains mostly isolated from the latter’s interconnections since tables lack links and computer-accessible descriptions of their structure. In other words, the schemas of these tables -- attribute names, values, data types, etc. -- are not explicitly stored as table metadata. Consequently, the structure that these tables contain is not accessible to the crawlers that power search engines and thus not accessible to user search queries. We address this lack of structure with a new method for leveraging the principles of table construction in order to extract table schemas. Discovering the schema by which a table is constructed is achieved by harnessing the similarities and differences of nearby table rows through the use of a novel set of features and a feature processing scheme. The schemas of these data tables are determined using a classification technique based on conditional random fields in combination with a novel feature encoding method called logarithmic binning, which is specifically designed for the data table extraction task. Our method provides considerable improvement over the well-known WebTables schema extraction method. In contrast with previous work that focuses on extracting individual relations, our method excels at correctly interpreting full tables, thereby being capable of handling general tables such as those found in spreadsheets, instead of being restricted to HTML tables as is the case with the WebTables method. We also extract additional schema characteristics, such as row groupings, which are important for supporting information retrieval tasks on tabular data.</p></div>

<p>Milad Eftekhar (University of Toronto), Nick Koudas (University of Toronto)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Online types of expression in the form of social networks, microblogging, blogs and rich content sharing platforms have proliferated in the last few years. Such proliferation contributed to  the vast explosion in online data  sharing we are experiencing today.

One unique aspect of online data  sharing is tags manually inserted by  content generators to facilitate content description and discovery (e.g., hashtags in tweets). In this paper we focus on these tags and we study and propose algorithms that make use of tags in order to automatically organize and categorize this vast collection of socially contributed and tagged information. In particular, we take  a holistic approach in organizing such tags and we propose algorithms to partition as well as rank this information collection. Our partitioning algorithms aim to segment the entire collection of tags (and the associated content) into a specified number of partitions for specific problem constraints. In contrast our ranking algorithms aim to identify few partitions fast, for suitably defined ranking functions.

We present a detailed experimental study utilizing the full twitter firehose (set of all tweets in the Twitter service) that attests to the practical utility and effectiveness of our overall approach. We also present a detailed qualitative study of our results.</p></div>

<p>Cynthia Dwork, Distinguished Scientist (Microsoft Research)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Privacy-preserving data analysis, also known as statistical disclosure control, has a large literature that spans several disciplines. Many early attempts have proved problematic either in practice or on paper. A new approach, based on the definitional concept of "differential privacy," has provided a theoretically sound and powerful framework that has given rise to an explosion of research. This talk motivates and explains the definition of differential privacy, describes some basic techniques for achieving it, and discusses some of the technical and cultural obstacles to bringing this approach to fruition.</p></div>

<p>Tao Zou (Cornell University), Ronan Le Bras (Cornell University), Marcos Vaz Salles (DIKU), Alan Demers (Cornell University), Johannes Gehrke (Cornell University)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>An increasing number of distributed data-driven applications are moving into shared public clouds. By sharing resources and operating at scale, public clouds promise higher utilization and lower costs than private clusters. To achieve high utilization, however, cloud providers must inevitably allocate virtual machine instances non-contiguously, i.e., instances of a given application may end up in physically distant machines in the cloud. This allocation strategy can lead to large differences in average latency between instances. For a large class of applications, this difference can result in significant performance degradation, unless care is taken in how application components are mapped to instances.

In this paper, we propose ClouDiA, a general deployment advisor that selects application node deployments minimizing either (i) the largest latency between application nodes, or (ii) the longest critical path among all application nodes. ClouDiA employs mixed-integer programming and constraint programming techniques to efficiently search the space of possible mappings of application nodes to instances. Through experiments with synthetic and real applications in Amazon EC2, we show that our techniques yield a 15% to 55% reduction in time-to-solution or service response time, without any need for modifying application code.</p></div>

<p>Foto Afrati (NTUA), Anish Das Sarma (Google Research), Semih Salihoglu (Stanford University), Jeffrey Ullman (Stanford University)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>In this paper we study the tradeoff between parallelism and communication cost in a map-reduce computation. For any problem that is not ``embarrassingly parallel,'' the finer we partition the work of the reducers so that more parallelism can be extracted, the greater will be the total communication between mappers and reducers. We introduce a model of problems that can be solved in a single round of map-reduce computation.  This model enables a generic recipe for discovering lower bounds on communication cost as a function of the maximum number of inputs that can be assigned to one reducer.   We use the model to analyze the tradeoff for three problems: finding pairs of strings at Hamming distance d, finding triangles and other patterns in a larger graph, and matrix multiplication.  For finding strings of Hamming distance 1, we have upper and lower bounds that match exactly.  For triangles and many other graphs, we have upper and lower bounds that are the same to within a constant factor.  For the problem of matrix multiplication, we have matching upper and lower bounds for one-round map-reduce algorithms.   We are also able to explore two-round map-reduce algorithms for matrix multiplication and show that these never have more communication, for a given reducer size, than the best one-round algorithm, and often have significantly less.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Generalized matching problems arise in a number of applications,
including computational advertising, recommender systems, and
trade markets. Consider, for example, the problem of recommending
multimedia items (e.g., DVDs) to users such that (1) users are recommended
items that they are likely to be interested in, (2) every user
gets neither too few nor too many recommendations, and (3) only
items available in stock are recommended to users. State-of-the-art
matching algorithms fail at coping with large real-world instances,
which may involve millions of users and items. We propose the
first distributed algorithm for computing near-optimal solutions to
large-scale generalized matching problems like the one above. Our
algorithm is designed to run on a small cluster of commodity nodes
(or in a MapReduce environment), has strong approximation guarantees,
and requires only a poly-logarithmic number of passes over
the input. In particular, we propose a novel distributed algorithm to
approximately solve so-called mixed packing-covering linear programs,
which include but are not limited to generalized matching
problems. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data suggest
that our algorithm scales to very large problem sizes and can be
orders of magnitude faster than alternative approaches.</p></div>

<p>Wenfei Fan (University of Edinburgh), Floris Geerts (University of Antwerp), Frank Neven (Hasselt University and transnational University of Limburg)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>A query class is traditionally considered tractable if there exists a polynomial-time (PTIME) algorithm to answer its queries. When it comes to big data, however, PTIME algorithms often become infeasible in practice. A traditional and effective approach to coping with this is to
preprocess data off-line, so that queries in the class can be subsequently evaluated on the data efficiently. This paper aims to provide a formal foundation for this approach in terms of computational complexity.
(1) We propose a set of Pi-tractable queries to characterize classes of queries that can be answered in parallel poly-logarithmic time (NC)  after PTIME preprocessing.
(2) We show that several natural query classes are Pi-tractable and are feasible on big data.
(3) We also study a set of query classes that can be effectively converted to Pi-tractable queries by re-factorizing its data and queries for preprocessing. We introduce a form of NC reductions to characterize such conversions. 
(4) We show that a natural query class is complete for the set of query classes that can be made Pi-tractable.
(5) We also show that unless P =NC, the set of all Pi-tractable queries is properly contained in the set P of all PTIME queries. Nonetheless, all PTIME query classes can be made P-tractable via proper re-factorizations. This work is a  step towards understanding the  tractability of queries in the context of big data. </p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>We analyze Hadoop workloads from three different research clusters
from a user-centric perspective.  The goal is to better understand
data scientists' use of the system and the mismatches between the system design and use.
Our analysis suggests that Hadoop usage is still in its adolescence.  
We see underuse of Hadoop features, extensions, and tools.
We see significant diversity in resource usage and application styles, including some ``interactive'' and ``iterative'' workloads, motivating new tools in the ecosystem.  
We also observe significant opportunities for optimizations of these workloads. 
We find that job customization and configuration are used in a narrow scope, suggesting the future pursuit of automatic tuning systems.
Overall, we present the first user-centered measurement study of Hadoop and find significant opportunities for improving its efficient use for data scientists.</p></div>

<p>Nikos Armenatzoglou (HKUST), Stavros Papadopoulos (HKUST), Dimitris Papadias (HKUST)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>The proliferation of GPS-enabled mobile devises and the popularity of social networking have recently led to the rapid growth of Geo-Social Networks (GeoSNs). GeoSNs have created a fertile ground for novel location-based social interactions and advertising. These can be facilitated by GeoSN queries, which extract useful information combining both the social relationships and the current location of the users. This paper constitutes the first systematic work on GeoSN query processing. We propose a general framework that offers flexible data management and algorithmic design. Our architecture segregates the social, geographical and query processing modules. Each GeoSN query is processed via a transparent combination of primitive queries issued to the social and geographical modules. We demonstrate the power of our framework by introducing several "basic" and "advanced" query types, and devising various solutions for each type. Finally, we perform an exhaustive experimental evaluation with real and synthetic datasets, based on realistic implementations with both commercial software (such as MongoDB) and state-of-the-art research methods. Our results confirm the viability of our framework in typical large-scale GeoSNs.  </p></div>

<p>Panagiotis Bouros (HKU), Shen Ge (HKU), Nikos Mamoulis (University of Hong Kong)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Given a collection of objects that carry both spatial and textual information, a spatio-textual similarity join retrieves the pairs of objects that are spatially close and textually similar. As an example, consider a social network with spatially and textually tagged persons (i.e., their locations and profiles). A useful task (for friendship recommendation) would be to find pairs of persons that are spatially close and their profiles have a large overlap (i.e., they have common interests). Another application is data de-duplication (e.g., finding photographs which are spatially close to each other and high overlap in their descriptive tags). Despite the importance of this operation, there is very little previous work that studies its efficient evaluation and in fact under a different definition; only the best match for each object is identified. In this paper, we combine ideas from state-of-the-art spatial distance join and set similarity join methods and propose efficient algorithms that take into account both spatial and textual constraints. Besides, we propose a batch processing technique which boosts the performance of our approaches. An experimental evaluation using real and synthetic datasets shows that our optimized techniques are orders of magnitude faster than baseline solutions. </p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Trajectories of moving objects are collected in many applications.  Raw trajectory data is typically very large, and has to be simplified before use.  In this paper, we introduce the notion of direction preserving trajectory simplification, and shows that it can support a broader range of applications than traditional position preserving trajectory simplification.  We present a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal direction preserving simplification, and another approximate algorithm with a quality guarantee.  Extensive experimental evaluation with real trajectory data shows the benefit of the new techniques.

<div class="paper_content"><p>Query autocompletion is an important feature saving users many keystrokes from typing the entire query. In this paper we study the problem of query autocompletion that tolerates errors in users’ input using edit distance constraints. Previous approaches index data strings in a trie, and continuously maintain all the prefixes of data strings whose edit distance with the query are within the threshold. The major inherent problem is that the number of such prefixes is huge for the first few characters of the query and is exponential in the alphabet size. This results in slow query time even if the entire query approximately matches only few prefixes. In this paper, we propose a novel neighborhood generation-based algorithm, IncNGTrie, which can achieve up to three orders of magnitude speedup over existing methods for the error-tolerant query autocompletion problem. Our proposed algorithm only maintains a small set of active nodes, thus saving both space and time to process the query. We also study efficient duplicate removal methods which is a core problem in fetching query answers. In addition, we propose optimization techniques to reduce our index size, as well as discussions on several extensions to our method. The efficiency of our method is demonstrated against existing methods through extensive experiments on real datasets.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Massive data analysis in cloud-scale data centers plays a crucial role in making critical business decisions. High-level scripting languages free developers from understanding various system trade-offs, but introduce new challenges for query optimization. One key optimization challenge is missing accurate data statistics, typically due to massive data volumes and their distributed nature, complex computation logic, and frequent usage of user-defined functions. In this paper we propose novel techniques to adapt query processing in the SCOPE system, the cloud-scale computation environment in Microsoft Online Services. We continuously monitor query execution, collect actual runtime statistics, and adapt parallel execution plans as the query executes. We discuss similarities and differences between our approach and alternatives proposed in the context of traditional centralized systems. Experiments on large-scale SCOPE production clusters show that the proposed techniques systematically solve the challenge of missing/inaccurate data statistics, detect and resolve partition skew and plan structure, and improve query latency by a few folds for real workloads. Although we focus on optimizing high-level languages, the same ideas are also applicable for MapReduce systems.</p></div>

Our proposed solution relies  on proper resource allocation for concurrent Hive jobs based on data dependency, inter-query optimization and modeling of Hadoop cluster load. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work towards Hive/MapReduce job optimization which takes Hadoop cluster load into consideration.    We perform an experimental study that demonstrates 233% reduction in execution time for concurrent vs sequential execution schema. We report up to 40% extra reduction in execution time for concurrent job execution after resource usage optimization.    The results reported in this paper were obtained in a pilot project to assess the feasibility of migrating A/B testing from Teradata + SAS analytics infrastructure to Hadoop.

<p>Khaled Elmeleegy, Turn Inc</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Cluster computing has emerged as a key parallel processing platform for large scale data. All major internet companies use it as their major central processing platform. One of cluster computing's most popular examples is MapReduce and its open source implementation Hadoop. These systems were originally designed for batch and massive-scale computations. Interestingly, over time their production workloads have evolved into a mix of a small fraction of large and long-running jobs and a much bigger fraction of short jobs. This came about because these systems end up being used as data warehouses, which store most of the data sets and attract ad-hoc, short, data-mining queries. Moreover, the availability of higher level query languages that operate on top of these cluster systems proliferated these ad-hoc queries. Since existing systems were not designed for short, latency-sensistive jobs, short interactive jobs suffer from poor response times.    In this paper, we present Piranha---a system for optimizing short jobs on Hadoop without affecting the larger jobs. It runs on existing unmodified Hadoop clusters facilitating its adoption.   Piranha exploits characteristics of short jobs learned from production workloads at Yahoo! clusters to reduce the latency of such jobs. To demonstrate Piranha's effectiveness, we evaluated its performance using three realistic short queries. Piranha was able to reduce the queries' response times by up to 71%.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Multiversion databases store both current and historical data.  Rows are typically annotated with timestamps representing the period when the row is/was valid.  We develop novel techniques for reducing index maintenance in multiversion databases, so that indexes can be used effectively for analytical queries over current data without being a heavy burden on transaction throughput. To achieve this end, we re-design persistent index data structures in the storage hierarchy to employ an extra level of indirection.  The indirection level is stored on solid state disks that can support very fast random I/Os, so that traversing the extra level of indirection incurs a relatively small overhead.    The extra level of indirection dramatically reduces the number of magnetic disk I/Os that are needed for index updates, and localizes maintenance to indexes on updated attributes.  Further, we batch insertions within the indirection layer in order to reduce physical disk I/Os for indexing new records. By reducing the index maintenance overhead on transactions, we enable operational data stores to create more indexes to support queries. We have developed a prototype of our indirection proposal by extending the widely used Generalized Search Tree (GiST) open-source project, which is also employed in Postgres.  Our working implementation demonstrates that we can significantly reduce index maintenance and/or query processing cost, by a factor of 3. For insertions of new records, our novel batching technique can save up to 90% of the insertion time.</p></div>

<p>Haichuan Shang (University of Tokyo), Masaru Kitsuregawa (University of Tokyo)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Finding the skyline in a multi-dimensional space is relevant to a wide range of applications. The skyline operator over a set of d-dimensional points selects the points that are not dominated by any other point on all dimensions. Therefore, it provides a minimal set of candidates for the users to make their personal trade-off among all optimal solutions. 

The existing algorithms establish both the worst case complexity by discarding distributions and the average case complexity by assuming dimensional independence. However, the data in the real world is more likely to be anti-correlated. The cardinality and complexity analysis on dimensionally independent data is meaningless when dealing with anti-correlated data. Furthermore, the performance of the existing algorithms becomes impractical on anti-correlated data.  

In this paper, we establish a cardinality model for anti-correlated distributions. We propose an accurate polynomial estimation for the expected value of the skyline cardinality. Because the high skyline cardinality downgrades the performance of most existing algorithms on anti-correlated data, we further develop a determination and elimination framework which extends the well-adopted elimination strategy. It achieves remarkable effectiveness and efficiency. The comprehensive experiments on both real datasets and benchmark synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms under a wide range of settings.</p></div>

<p>Risi Thonangi (Duke University), Jun Yang (Duke University)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Permutation is a fundamental operator for array data, with appli-
cations in, for example, changing matrix layouts and reorganizing
data cubes. We consider the problem of permuting large quantities
of data stored on secondary storage supporting fast random block
accesses, such as solid state drives and distributed key-value stores.
Faster random accesses open up interesting new opportunities for
permutation. While external merge sort has often been used for
permutation, it is an overkill that fails to exploit the property of
permutation fully and carries unnecessary overhead in storing and
comparing keys. We propose faster algorithms with lower mem-
ory requirements for a large, useful class of permutations. We also
tackle practical challenges that traditional permutation algorithms
have not dealt with, such as exploiting random block accesses more
aggressively, considering the cost asymmetry between reads and
writes, and handling arbitrary data dimension sizes (as opposed to
perfect powers often assumed by previous work). As a result, our
algorithms are faster and more broadly applicable.

<div class="paper_content"><p>Vertical partitioning is a crucial step in physical database design in row-oriented databases. A number of vertical partitioning algorithms have been proposed over the last three decades for a variety of niche scenarios. In principle, the underlying problem remains the same: decompose a table into one or more vertical partitions. However, it is not clear how good different vertical partitioning algorithms are in comparison to each other. In fact, it is not even clear how to experimentally compare different vertical partitioning algorithms. In this paper, we present an exhaustive experimental study of several vertical partitioning algorithms. We categorize vertical partitioning algorithms along three dimensions. We survey six vertical partitioning algorithms and discuss their pros and cons. We identify the major differences in the use-case settings for different algorithms and describe how to make an apples-to-apples comparison of different vertical partitioning algorithms under the same setting. We propose four metrics to compare vertical partitioning algorithms. We show experimental results from the TPC-H and SSB benchmark and present four key lessons learned: (1) we can do four orders of magnitude less computation and still find the optimal layouts, (2) the benefits of vertical partitioning depend strongly on the database buffer size, (3) HillClimb is the best vertical partitioning algorithm, and (4) vertical partitioning for TPC-H-like benchmarks can improve over column layout by only up to 5%.</p></div>

<p>Iraklis Psaroudakis (EPFL), Manos Athanassoulis (EPFL), Anastasia Ailamaki (EPFL)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Today's data deluge enables organizations to collect massive data, and analyze it with an ever-increasing number of concurrent queries. Traditional data warehouses (DW) face a challenging problem in executing this task, due to their query-centric model: each query is optimized and executed independently. This model results in high contention for resources. Thus, modern DW depart from the query-centric model to execution models involving sharing of common data and work. Our goal is to show when and how a DW should employ sharing. We evaluate experimentally two sharing methodologies, based on their original prototype systems, that exploit work sharing opportunities among concurrent queries at run-time: Simultaneous Pipelining (SP), which shares intermediate results of common sub-plans, and Global Query Plans (GQP), which build and evaluate a single query plan with shared operators.

First, after a short review of sharing methodologies, we show that SP and GQP are orthogonal techniques. SP can be applied to shared operators of a GQP, reducing response times by 20%-48% in workloads with numerous common sub-plans. Second, we corroborate previous results on the negative impact of SP on performance for cases of low concurrency. We attribute this behaviour to a bottleneck caused by the push-based communication model of SP. We show that pull-based communication for SP eliminates the overhead of sharing altogether for low concurrency, and scales better on multi-core machines than push-based SP, further reducing response times by 82%-86% for high concurrency. Third, we perform an experimental analysis of SP, GQP and their combination, and show when each one is beneficial. We identify a trade-off between low and high concurrency. In the former case, traditional query-centric operators with SP perform better, while in the latter case, GQP with shared operators enhanced by SP give the best results.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>A k-core of a graph is a maximal connected subgraph in which every
vertex is connected to at least k vertices in the subgraph. k-core
decomposition is often used in large-scale network analysis, such
as community detection, protein function prediction, visualization,
and solving NP-Hard problems on real networks efficiently, like
maximal clique finding. In many real-world applications, networks
change over time. As a result, it is essential to develop efficient
incremental algorithms for streaming graph data. In this paper, we
propose the first incremental k-core decomposition algorithms for
streaming graph data. These algorithms locate a small subgraph
that is guaranteed to contain the list of vertices whose maximum
k-core values have to be updated, and efficiently process this subgraph
to update the k-core decomposition. Our results show a significant
reduction in run-time compared to non-incremental alternatives.
We show the efficiency of our algorithms on different types
of real and synthetic graphs, at different scales. For a graph of
16 million vertices, we observe speedups reaching a million times,
relative to the non-incremental algorithms.</p></div>

<p>Bin Yang (Aarhus University), Chenjuan Guo (Aarhus University), Christian S. Jensen (Arhus University)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>The monitoring of a system yields a set of measurements that can be modeled as a collection of time series. These time series are often sparse due to missing measurements and spatio-temporally correlated, meaning that near-by time series exhibit temporal correlations. The analysis of such time series offers insight into the underlying  systems and enables prediction of system behavior. While the techniques presented in the paper are applicable more generally, we consider the case of transportation systems and aim to predict travel cost from GPS tracking data obtained from probe vehicles. Specifically, each road segment has an associated travel cost time series.

We use spatio-temporal hidden Markov models (STHMM) to model correlations among different traffic time series. We provide a set of algorithms that are able to learn the parameters of an STHMM, while contending with the sparsity, spatio-temporal correlation, and heterogeneity of the time series. Using the resulting STHMM, near future travel costs in the transportation network, e.g., travel time or greenhouse gas emissions, can be inferred, enabling a variety of routing services, e.g., eco-routing. Empirical studies with a substantial GPS data set offer insight into the design properties of the proposed framework and algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of travel cost inferencing.

<div class="paper_content"><p>Social content, such as Twitter updates, often have the quickest first-hand reports of news events, as well as numerous commentaries that are indicative of public view of such events. As such, social updates provide a good complement to professionally written news articles. In this paper we consider the problem of automatically annotating news stories with social updates (tweets), at a news website serving high volume of pageviews. The high rate of both the pageviews (millions to billions a day) and of the incoming tweets (more than 100 millions a day) make real-time indexing of tweets ineffective, as this requires an index that is both queried and updated extremely frequently. The rate of tweet updates makes caching techniques almost unusable since the cache would become stale very quickly.

We propose a novel architecture where each story is treated as a subscription for tweets relevant to the story's content, and new  algorithms that efficiently match tweets to stories, proactively maintaining the top-k tweets for each story. Such top-k pub-sub consumes only a small fraction of the resource cost of alternative solutions, and can be applicable to other large scale content-based publish-subscribe problems. We evaluate and show the effectiveness of our approach on real-world data: a corpus of news stories from Yahoo! News and a log of Twitter updates.</p></div>

<p>Minos Garofalakis (Technical University of Crete (Greece), Daniel Keren (Haifa University), Vasilis Samoladas (Technical University of Crete)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Emerging large-scale monitoring applications rely on continuous tracking of 
complex data-analysis queries over collections of massive, physically-distributed 
data streams.  Thus, in addition to the space- and time-efficiency requirements 
of conventional stream processing (at each remote monitor site), effective solutions 
also need to guarantee communication efficiency (over the underlying communication 
network).  The complexity of the monitored query adds to the difficulty of the 
problem --- this is  especially true for non-linear queries (e.g., joins), where 
no obvious solutions exist for distributing the monitor condition across sites. 
The recently proposed geometric method offers a generic methodology for splitting 
an arbitrary (non-linear) global threshold-monitoring task into a collection of 
local site constraints; still, the approach relies on maintaining the complete 
stream(s) at each site, thus raising serious efficiency concerns for massive data 
streams.
In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for efficiently tracking a broad class 
of complex aggregate queries in such distributed-streams settings. Our tracking schemes 
rely on a novel combination of the geometric method with compact sketch summaries of 
local data streams, and maintain approximate answers with provable error guarantees, 
while optimizing space and processing costs at each remote site and communication 
cost across the network. One of our key technical insights for the effective use of 
the geometric method lies in exploiting a much lower-dimensional space for monitoring
the sketch-based estimation query.  Due to the complex, highly non-linear nature of 
these estimates, 
efficiently monitoring the local geometric constraints poses challenging algorithmic 
issues for which we propose novel solutions. Experimental results on real-life data 
streams verify the effectiveness of our approach.

<div class="paper_content"><p>For various entering and transmission issues raised by human or system, missing events often occur in event data, which record the execution logs of business processes. Without recovering these missing events, applications such as provenance analysis or complex event processing built upon event data are not reliable. Following the minimum change discipline in improving data quality, it is also rational to find a recovery that minimally differs from the original data. Existing recovery approaches fall short of efficiency owing to enumerating and searching over all the possible sequences of events. In this paper, we study the efficient techniques for recovering missing events. According to our theoretical results, the recovery problem is proved to be NP-hard. Nevertheless, we are able to concisely represent the space of event sequences in a branching framework. Advanced indexing and pruning techniques are developed to further improve the recovery efficiency. Our proposed efficient techniques make it possible to find top-k recoveries. The experimental results demonstrate that our minimum recovery approach achieves high accuracy, and significantly outperforms stateof-the-art techniques for up to 5 orders of magnitudes improvement in time performance.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>  The problem of scaling up data integration, such that new sources can be quickly utilized as they are discovered, remains elusive: global schemas for integrated data are difficult to develop and expand, and schema and record matching techniques are limited by the fact that data and metadata are often under-specified and must be disambiguated by data experts.  One promising approach is to avoid using a global schema, and instead to develop keyword search-based data integration --- where the system lazily discovers associations enabling it to join together matches to keywords, and return ranked results. The user is expected to understand the data domain and provide feedback about answers' quality.  The system generalizes such feedback to learn how to correctly integrate data.

  A major open challenge is that under this model, the user only sees and offers feedback on a few top-k results: this result set must be carefully selected to include answers of high relevance and answers that are highly informative when feedback is given on them.  Existing systems merely focus on predicting relevance, by composing the scores of various schema and record matching algorithms.  In this paper we show how to predict the uncertainty associated with a query result's score, as well as how informative feedback is on a given result.  We build upon these foundations to develop an active learning approach to keyword search-based data integration, and we validate the effectiveness of our solution over real data from several very different domains.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Schema mappings establish a correspondence between data stored in two databases, called source and target respectively.  Query processing under schema mappings has been investigated extensively in the two cases where each target atom is mapped to a query over the source (called GAV, global-as-view), and where each source atom is mapped to a query over the target (called LAV, local-as-view).  The general case, called GLAV, in which queries over the source are mapped to queries over the target, has attracted a lot of attention recently, especially for data exchange.  However, query processing for GLAV mappings has been considered only for the basic service of query answering, and mainly in the context of conjunctive queries (CQs) in relational databases.  In this paper we study query processing for GLAV mappings in a wider sense, considering not only query answering, but also query rewriting, perfectness (the property of a rewriting to compute exactly the certain answers), and query containment relative to a mapping. We deal both with the relational case, and with graph databases, where the basic querying mechanism is that of regular path queries.  Query answering in GLAV can be smoothly reduced to a combination of the LAV and GAV cases, and for CQs this reduction can be exploited also for the remaining query processing tasks.  In contrast, as we show, GLAV query processing for graph databases is non-trivial and requires new insights and techniques.  We obtain upper bounds for answering, rewriting, and perfectness, and show decidability of relative containment.</p></div>

<div class="paper_content"><p>Large-scale integration of heterogeneous data sources is a challenging problem, and has been the topic of extensive research for many years. A basic step in integration is the identification of linkage points, i.e., finding the attributes that are shared (or related) between the data sources, and that can be used to match records or entities across the sources. This is usually performed using a match operator, that associates the schema elements of one database to another. However, the massive growth in the amount of unstructured and semi-structured data in data warehouses and on the Web has created new challenges for this task. Such data sources often do not have a fixed pre-defined schema and contain large numbers of diverse attributes. Furthermore, the end goal is not schema alignment as these schemas may be too heterogeneous (and dynamic) to meaningfully align. Rather, the goal is to align any overlapping data shared by these sources. We will show that even attributes with different meanings (that would not qualify as schema matches) can sometimes be useful in aligning data. The solution we propose in this paper replaces the basic schema-matching step with a more complex instance-based schema analysis and linkage discovery. We present a framework consisting of a library of efficient lexical analyzers and similarity functions, and a set of search algorithms for effective and efficient identification of linkage points over Web data. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in real-world integration scenarios in several domains.</p></div>

<p>Chen Zhang (HKUST), Lei Chen (Honk Kong University of Science and Technology), Hosagrahar Jagadish (University of Michigan), Chen Cao (HKUST)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Schema matching is a central challenge for data integration systems. Automated tools are often uncertain about schema matchings they suggest, and this uncertainty is inherent since it arises from the inability of the schema to fully capture the semantics of the represented data. Human common sense can often help. Inspired by the popularity and the success of easily accessible crowdsourcing platforms, we explore the use of crowdsourcing to reduce the uncertainty of schema matching.

Since it is typical to ask simple questions on crowdsourcing platforms, we assume that each question, namely  Correspondence Correctness Question (CCQ), is to ask the crowd to decide whether a given correspondence should exist in the correct matching. We propose frameworks and efficient algorithms to dynamically manage the CCQs, in order to maximize the uncertainty reduction within a limited budget of questions. We develop two novel approaches, namely “Single CCQ” and “Multiple CCQ”, which adaptively select, publish and manage the questions. We verified the value of our solutions with simulation and real implementation.</p></div>

<p>Xin Luna Dong (Google Inc.), Barna Saha (AT&amp;T Labs-Research), Divesh Srivastava (AT&amp;T Labs-Research)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>We are often thrilled by the abundance of information surrounding
us and wish to integrate data from as many sources as possible. However, understanding, analyzing, and using these data are often
hard. Too much data can introduce a huge integration cost, such
as expenses for purchasing data and resources for integration and
cleaning. Furthermore, including low-quality data can even deteriorate
the quality of integration results instead of bringing the desired
quality gain. Thus, “the more the better” does not always hold
for data integration and often “less is more”.

In this paper, we study how to select a subset of sources before
integration such that we can balance the quality of integrated
data and integration cost. Inspired by the Marginalism principle
in economic theory, we wish to integrate a new source only if its
marginal gain, often a function of improved integration quality, is
higher than the marginal cost, associated with data-purchase expense
and integration resources. As a first step towards this goal,
we focus on data fusion tasks, where the goal is to resolve conflicts
from different sources. We propose a randomized solution for
selecting sources for fusion and show empirically its effectiveness
and scalability on both real-world data and synthetic data.</p></div>

<p>Mohamed F. Mokbel (University of Minnesota), Mohamed Sarwat (University of Minnesota)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Online social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter have become very popular in the past decade. Users register to online social networks in order to keep in touch with their friends and family, learn about their news, get recommendations from them, and engage in online social events. As mobile devices (e.g., smart phones, GPS devices) became ubiquitous, location-based social networking services (e.g., Foursquare and Facebook Places) are getting more and more popular. For instance, as of September 2012, Foursquare claims to have over 25 million people worldwide, and over billions of check-ins with millions more every day. Users, in a location-based social network, are associated with a geo-location, and might alert friends when visiting a venue (e.g., restaurant, bar) by checking-in on their mobile phones (e.g., iPhone, Android). The rise of location-based social networking applications has led to the emergence of both social networking and mobility side by side, which led to the rise of new research challenges and opportunities. This tutorial presents the state-of-the-art research that lies at the intersection of both: Social Networking and Mobility. Data management research in social networking is mainly concerned with managing users social interactions and collaboration, storing / retrieving social media (e.g., Microblogs, News Feed), and analyzing users behavior. Data management research in mobility focuses on handling user GeoSpatial location and contextual information. This tutorial takes an overarching approach by surveying the research that combines both social networking and mobility from four different perspectives: (1) Microblog search and social news feed queries, (2) Recommendation Services, (3) Crowdsourcing, and (4) Social Media Visualization. We finally highlight the risks and threats (e.g., privacy) that result from combining mobility and social networking, and we conclude the tutorial by summarizing and presenting some open research directions.</p></div>

<p>Wentao Wu (University of Wisconsin-Madison), Yun Chi (NEC Laboratories America), Hakan Hacigumus (NEC Laboratories America), Jeffrey Naughton (University of Wisconsin-Madison)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Predicting query execution time is crucial for many database management tasks including admission control, query scheduling, and progress monitoring. While a number of recent papers have explored this problem, the bulk of the existing work either considers prediction for a single query, or prediction for a static workload of concurrent queries, where by "static" we mean that the queries to be run are fixed and known. In this paper, we consider the more general problem of dynamic concurrent workloads. Unlike most previous work on query execution time prediction, our proposed framework is based on analytic modeling rather than machine learning. We first use the optimizer’s cost model to estimate the I/O and CPU requirements for each pipeline of each query in isolation, and then use a combination queueing model and buffer pool model that merges the I/O and CPU requests from concurrent queries to predict running times. We compare the proposed approach with a machine-learning based approach that is a variant of previous work. Our experiments show that our analytic-model based approach can lead to competitive and often better prediction accuracy than its machine-learning based counterpart.</p></div>

<p>Kun Ren (Yale University &amp; Northwestern Polytechnical University, China), Alexander Thomson (Yale University), Daniel Abadi (Yale University)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Locking is widely used as a concurrency control mechanism
in database systems. As more OLTP databases are stored
mostly or entirely in memory, transactional throughput is
less and less limited by disk IO, and lock managers increas-
ingly become performance bottlenecks.
In this paper, we introduce very lightweight locking (VLL),
an alternative approach to pessimistic concurrency control
for main-memory database systems that avoids almost all
overhead associated with traditional lock manager opera-
tions. We also propose a protocol called selective contention
analysis (SCA), which enables systems implementing VLL
to achieve high transactional throughput under high con-
tention workloads. We implement these protocols both in
a traditional single-machine multi-core database server set-
ting and in a distributed database where data is partitioned
across many commodity machines in a shared-nothing clus-
ter. Our experiments show that VLL dramatically reduces
locking overhead and thereby increases transactional through-
put in both settings.

<p>Thanh Tran (UMass (Amherst), Yanlei Diao (University of Massachusetts Amherst), Charles Sutton (University of Edinburgh), Anna Liu (UMass (Amherst)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Uncertain data management has become crucial in many sensing and scientific applications. As user-defined functions (UDFs) become widely used in these applications, an important task is to capture result uncertainty for queries that evaluate UDFs on uncertain data. In this work, we provide a general framework for supporting  UDFs on uncertain data. Specifically, we proposed a learning approach based on Gaussian processes (GPs) to compute approximate output distributions of a UDF when evaluated on uncertain input, with guaranteed error bounds. We also devise an  online algorithm to compute such output distributions, which employs a suite of optimizations to improve accuracy and performance. Our evaluation using both real-world  and synthetic functions shows that our proposed GP approach can outperform the state-of-the-art sampling approach with up to two orders of magnitude improvement for a variety of UDFs. </p></div>

<p>Yupeng Fu (University of California (San Diego), Raghav Kaushik (Microsoft Corporation), Ravi Ramamurthy (Microsoft Corporation)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>This paper studies the following problem: given (1)~a query and (2)~a set of sensitive records, find the subset of records ``accessed'' by the query. The notion of a query accessing a single record is adopted from prior work. There are several scenarios where the number of sensitive records is large (in the millions.) The novel challenge addressed in this work is to develop a general-purpose solution for complex SQL that scales in the number of sensitive records. We propose efficient techniques that improves upon straightforward alternatives by orders of magnitude. Our empirical evaluation over the TPC-H benchmark data illustrates the benefits of our techniques. </p></div>

<p>Ting Deng (Beihang University), Wenfei Fan (University of Edinburgh)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>Query result diversification is a bi-criteria optimization problem for ranking query results. Given a database D, a query Q and a positive integer k, it is to find a set of k tuples from Q(D) such that the tuples are as relevant as possible to the query, and at the same time, as diverse as possible to each other. Subsets of Q(D) are ranked by an objective function defined in terms of relevance and diversity. Query result diversification has found a variety of applications in databases, information retrieval and operations research.

This paper studies the complexity of result diversification for relational queries. We identify three problems in connection with query result diversification, to determine whether there exists a set of k tuples that is ranked above a bound with respect to relevance and diversity, to assess the rank of a given k-element set, and to count how many k-element sets are ranked above a given bound. We study these problems for a variety of query languages and for three objective functions. We establish the upper and lower bounds of these problems, all matching, for both combined complexity and data complexity. We also investigate several special settings of these problems, identifying tractable cases.

<p>Maurice Hendrix (Serious Games Institute, Coventry University)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>The use of games in education is becoming increasingly popular, as it can, in some cases, significantly improve learning outcomes over traditional methods (Knight et al., 2010). At the same time, a blended learning approach (Garrison and Vaughan, 2008), in which the use of games is combined with other technologies and classroom-based education is becoming increasingly popular. Many institutions have adopted a Learning Management System, an on-line system for managing digital learning material, where the course contents get uploaded and where students can log in, explore the course contents, take tests or engage in learning activities. While LMSs are useful for distance education only courses, they are increasingly regularly used in conjunction with traditional classroom-based courses in a blended approach. A significant volume of research has been conducted into e-learning and a number of standards have emerged. However, games differ from traditional digital media such as texts, in that they often bundle multiple learning objectives into a package coupled with game play mechanics and dynamics and as a result the integration of games into e-learning standards and into systems such as LMSs mostly limited to linking, leaving the job of blending them into the curriculum up to the teacher. Learning analytics (Ferguson, 2012) is a new emerging trend. For educational games this means that the difficulty, environment, amount of guidance via non player characters etc can be adapted to the learner’s knowledge and learning style. It also means that data mining can be used to establish, what learners really do in these games, and the course in general and whether there is a pattern that successful students have in common. This could then be used to improve the game, and the course as a whole. Advances we have made recently include re-use and re-purposing tools for educational games (Protopsaltis et al., 2011), integration of educational game authoring tools and adaptive hypermedia authoring tools (Hendrix et al., 2013) and direct integrations between games and LMSs via a JavaScript library and XML messages (Dunwell et al., 2011). However a standard is clearly required. Some educational games take a different approach altogether. For example the European-funded Mobile Assistance for Social Inclusion and Empowerment of Immigrants with Persuasive Learning Technologies and Social Network Services (MASELTOV) project seeks to provide both practical tools and learning services via mobile devices. The learning services include an educational game. However unlike many other educational games it is not part of a formal curriculum. Therefore instead of integrating it into an LMS, it is distributed as a few to play game via the Google Play store (https://play.google.com/‎). A lose integration with other services, for example allowing users to gain points that can be spent on upgrades in game, is achieved via web-services. Deployment in this way has the potential to reach large and gather data about audiences, such as play times, locations and which areas of the game are proving problematic as well as which other (MASELTOV) sources the user uses. The play store allows updating of games, so it is possible to respond to results of data analysis with improved versions of the game.</p></div>

<p>Evaggelia Pitoura (University of Ioannina, Greece)</p>
<div class="paper_content"><p>What makes a query result interesting besides relevance? This talk focuses on two of the many ranking criteria: (a) diversity and (b) change through time. Diversity has recently attracted a lot of attention as a means of increasing user satisfaction in recommendation systems, information retrieval and database queries. Diversification takes many forms such as increasing novelty and covering different query aspects and user information needs. In our recent research, we have proposed efficient indexing techniques for supporting continuous diversification as well as a new definition of diversity based on graph theory that provides a novel perspective to the problem. Then, I will touch upon our new work on capturing and querying the history of evolving social graphs through time</p></div>
